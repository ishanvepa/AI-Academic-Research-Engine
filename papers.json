[{"title":"Clinical Outcomes of Robotic Surgery Compared to Conventional Surgical Approaches (Laparoscopic or Open)","abstract":"Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text Objective: Describe clinical outcomes (eg, postoperative complications, survival) after robotic surgery compared to open or laparoscopic surgery. Background: Robotic surgery utilization has increased over the years across a wide range of surgical procedures. However, evidence supporting improved clinical outcomes after robotic surgery is limited. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of systematic reviews from inception to January 2019 for systematic reviews describing postoperative outcomes after robotic surgery. We qualitatively described patient outcomes of commonly performed robotic procedures: radical prostatectomy, hysterectomy, lobectomy, thymectomy, rectal resection, partial nephrectomy, distal gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, hepatectomy, distal pancreatectomy, and cholecystectomy. Results: One hundred fifty-four systematic reviews included 336 studies and 18 randomized controlled trials reporting on patient outcomes after robotic compared to laparoscopic or open procedures. Data from the randomized controlled trials demonstrate that robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy offered fewer biochemical recurrence and improvement in quality of recovery and pain scores only up to 6 weeks postoperatively compared to open radical prostatectomy. When compared to laparoscopic prostatectomy, robotic surgery offered improved urinary and sexual functions. Robotic surgery for endometrial cancer had fewer conversion to open compared to laparoscopic. Otherwise, robotic surgery outcomes were similar to conventional surgical approaches for other procedures except for radical hysterectomy where minimally invasive approaches may result in patient harm compared to open approach. Conclusion: Robotic surgery has been widely incorporated into practise despite limited supporting evidence. More rigorous research focused on patient-important benefits is needed before further expansion of robotic surgery.","authors":"H. Muaddi, M\u00e9lanie El Hafid, W.

Improved surgeon experience allows very large or very complex resections, such as in a previously irradiated field where spontaneous healing is functionally insufficient or is at high risk of postoperative complications. We demonstrated very satisfactory feasibility and postoperative outcomes with a free flap microvascular reconstruction in this category of patients. TORS and free flap reconstruction has a place as a standard of care in a number of complex situations. Abstract We reviewed the indications, peroperative feasibility, and postoperative clinical outcomes of our first 50 consecutive patients who underwent free flap reconstruction after TORS for complex pharyngeal defects at our institution. We analyzed indications according to previous radiotherapy, the size of the resection, and the transoral exposure of critical structures. We reviewed surgical data, postoperative complications, and functional outcomes comprising tracheostomy and alimentation management. Indications were upfront surgery (34%), a second primary surgery after radiotherapy (28%), or salvage surgery after chemoradiotherapy failure (38%). Localizations were the tongue base (44%), tonsillar fossa (28%), pharyngeal wall (22%), and soft palate (6%). T-classifications were T1 (6%), T2 (52%), T3 (20%), and T4 (22%). The mean length of the surgery was 574 min. Two patients were intraoperatively converted to a conventional approach at the beginning of the learning curve. In conclusion, TORS and free flap reconstruction in complex situations were associated with low rates of postoperative complications and satisfactory functional outcomes. They were, however, associated with a renewed learning curve.","authors":"P. Gorphe, S. Temam, A. Moya-Plana, N. Leymarie, F. Kolb, A. Bout-Roumazeilles, Q. Qassemyar, N. Benmoussa, J.

This study examines the short-term clinical outcomes of an international RCS training programme (the European Academy of Robotic Colorectal Surgery\u2014EARCS). Consecutive cases from 26 European colorectal units who conducted RCS between 2014 and 2018 were included in this study. The baseline characteristics and short-term outcomes of cases performed by EARCS delegates during training were analysed and compared with cases performed by EARCS graduates and proctors. Data from 1130 RCS procedures were collected and classified into three cohort groups (323 training, 626 graduates and 181 proctors). The training cases conversion rate was 2.2% and R1 resection rate was 1.5%. The three groups were similar in terms of baseline characteristics with the exception of malignant cases and rectal resections performed. With the exception of operative time, blood loss and hospital stay (training vs. graduate vs. proctor: operative time 302, 265, 255 min, p\u2009<\u20090.001; blood loss 50, 50, 30 ml, p\u2009<\u20090.001; hospital stay 7, 6, 6 days, p\u2009=\u20090.003), all remaining short-term outcomes (conversion, 30-day reoperation, 30-day readmission, 30-day mortality, clinical anastomotic leak, complications, R1 resection and lymph node yield) were comparable between the three groups. Colorectal surgeons learning how to perform RCS under the EARCS-structured training pathway can safely achieve short-term clinical outcomes comparable to their trainers and overcome the learning process in a way that minimises patient harm.","authors":"S.

METHODS: In this prospective randomized study from 2015 to 2017, eighty-nine patients with endometrial carcinoma that was clinically restricted to the uterus were randomized in robotic surgery (44 cases) and traditional laparoscopic surgery (45 cases). We compared the number of retrieved lymph nodes, total time of surgery, time of each surgical step, blood loss, length of hospital stay, major and minor complications, conversion rates and costs. RESULTS: The ages of the patients ranged from 47 to 69 years. The median body mass index was 31.1 (21.4-54.2) in the robotic surgery arm and 31.6 (22.9-58.6) in the traditional laparoscopic arm. The median tumor sizes were 4.0 (1.5-10.0) cm and 4.0 (0.0-9.0) cm in the robotic and traditional laparoscopic surgery groups, respectively. The median total numbers of lymph nodes retrieved were 19 (3-61) and 20 (4-34) in the robotic and traditional laparoscopic surgery arms, respectively. The median total duration of the whole procedure was 319.5 (170-520) minutes in the robotic surgery arm and 248 (85-465) minutes in the traditional laparoscopic arm. Eight major complications were registered in each group. The total cost was 41% higher for robotic surgery than for traditional laparoscopic surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Robotic surgery for endometrial cancer presented equivalent perioperative morbidity to that of traditional laparoscopic surgery. The duration and total cost of robotic surgery were higher than those of traditional laparoscopic surgery.","authors":"A. S. E. Silva, J. P. M. de Carvalho, C. Anton, R. Fernandes, E. Baracat, J.

Prospective randomized clinical trials comparing laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) and RG are thus required.\n\n\nObjective\nTo compare the short-term surgical outcomes of RG with those of LG for patients with gastric cancer.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nIn this phase 3, prospective superiority randomized clinical trial of RG vs LG regarding reduction of complications, 241 patients with resectable gastric cancer (clinical stages I-III) were enrolled between April 1, 2018, and October 31, 2020.\n\n\nInterventions\nLG vs RG.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nThe primary end point was the incidence of postoperative intra-abdominal infectious complications. Secondary end points were incidence of any complications, surgical results, postoperative courses, and oncologic outcomes. The modified intention-to-treat population excluded patients who had been randomized and met the postrandomization exclusion criteria. There was also a per-protocol population for analysis of postoperative complications.\n\n\nResults\nThis study enrolled 241 patients, with 236 patients in the modified intention-to-treat population (150 men [63.6%]; mean [SD] age, 70.8 [10.7] years). There was no significant difference in the incidence of intra-abdominal infectious complications (per-protocol population: 10 of 117 [8.5%] in the LG group vs 7 of 113 [6.2%] in the RG group). Of 241 patients, 122 were randomly assigned to the LG group, and 119 patients were randomly assigned to the RG group. Two of the 122 patients (1.6%) in the LG group converted from LG to open surgery, and 4 of 119 patients (3.4%) in the RG group converted from RG to open or laparoscopic surgery, with no significant difference. Finally, 117 patients in the LG group completed the procedure, and 113 in the RG group completed the procedure; these populations were defined as the per-protocol population. The overall incidence of postoperative complications of grade II or higher was significantly higher in the LG group (23 [19.7%]) than in the RG group (10 [8.8%]) (P\u2009=\u2009.02). Even in analysis limited to grade IIIa or higher, the complication rate was still significantly higher in the LG group (19 [16.2%]) than in the RG group (6 [5.3%]) (P\u2009=\u2009.01).\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nThis study found no reduction of intra-abdominal infectious complications with RG compared with LG for gastric cancer.\n\n\nTrial Registration\numin.ac.jp\/ctr Identifier: UMIN000031536.","authors":"T.

Methods: A retrospective single-center study was conducted comparing consecutively performed robotic-assisted and laparoscopic surgeries for rectal cancer between 1 January 2016 and 31 September 2021. In total, 125 adult patients with sporadic rectal adenocarcinoma (distal extent \u2264 15 cm from the anal verge) underwent surgery where 66 were operated on robotically and 59 laparoscopically. Results: Severe postoperative complications occurred less frequently with robotic-assisted compared with laparoscopic surgery, as indicated by Clavien\u2013Dindo classification grades 3b\u20135 (13.6% vs. 30.5%, p = 0.029). Multiple logistic regression analyses after backward selection revealed that robotic-assisted surgery was associated with a lower rate of total (Clavien\u2013Dindo grades 1\u20135) (OR = 0.355; 95% CI 0.156\u20130.808; p = 0.014) and severe postoperative complications (Clavien\u2013Dindo grades 3b\u20135) (OR = 0.243; 95% CI 0.088\u20130.643; p = 0.005).

The primary outcome measure (surgical accuracy) has previously been reported, and, along with secondary outcomes, were collected at one-, two-, and five-year timepoints. Analysis of five-year results and longitudinal analysis for all timepoints was performed to compare the two groups. Results Overall, 104 (80%) patients of the original 130 who received surgery were available at five years (55 robotic, 49 manual). Both procedures reported successful results over all outcomes. At five years, there were no statistical differences between the groups in any of the patient reported or clinical outcomes. There was a lower reintervention rate in the robotic arm-assisted group with 0% requiring further surgery compared with six (9%) of the manual group requiring additional surgical intervention (p < 0.001). Conclusion This study has shown excellent clinical outcomes in both groups with no statistical or clinical differences in the patient-reported outcome measures. The notable difference was the lower reintervention rate at five years for roboticarm-assisted UKA when compared with a manual approach.

This systematic review compared robotic VHR with laparoscopic and open approaches. Methods This systematic review was undertaken in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for articles with terms relating to \u2018robot-assisted\u2019, \u2018cost effectiveness\u2019, and \u2018ventral hernia\u2019 or \u2018incisional hernia\u2019 from 1 January 2010 to 10 November 2020. Intraoperative and postoperative outcomes, pain, recurrence, and cost data were extracted for narrative analysis. Results Of 25 studies that met the inclusion criteria, three were RCTs and 22 observational studies. Robotic VHR was associated with a longer duration of operation than open and laparoscopic repairs, but with fewer transfusions, shorter hospital stay, and lower complication rates than open repair. Robotic VHR was more expensive than laparoscopic repair, but not significantly different from open surgery in terms of cost. There were no significant differences in rates of intraoperative complication, conversion to open surgery, surgical-site infection, readmission, mortality, pain, or recurrence between the three approaches. Conclusion Robotic VHR was associated with a longer duration of operation, fewer transfusions, a shorter hospital stay, and fewer complications compared with open surgery. Robotic VHR had higher costs and a longer operating time than laparoscopic repair. Randomized or matched data with standardized reporting, long-term outcomes, and cost-effectiveness analyses are still required to weigh the clinical benefits against the cost of robotic VHR.","authors":"Linda Ye, C.

This population-based cohort study aimed to compare rates of textbook outcomes (TOs) and survival from robotic minimally invasive techniques for esophagogastric cancer. Data from the United States National Cancer Database (NCDB) (2010\u20132017) were used to identify patients with non-metastatic esophageal or gastric cancer receiving open surgery (to the esophagus, n = 11,442; stomach, n = 22,183), laparoscopic surgery (to the esophagus [LAMIE], n = 4827; stomach [LAMIG], n = 6359), or robotic surgery (to the esophagus [RAMIE], n = 1657; stomach [RAMIG], n = 1718). The study defined TOs as 15 or more lymph nodes examined, margin-negative resections, hospital stay less than 21 days, no 30-day readmissions, and no 90-day mortalities. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox analyses were used to account for treatment selection bias. Patients receiving robotic surgery were more commonly treated in high-volume academic centers with advanced clinical T and N stage disease. From 2010 to 2017, TO rates increased for esophageal and gastric cancer treated via all surgical techniques. Compared with open surgery, significantly higher TO rates were associated with RAMIE (odds ratio [OR], 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27\u20131.58) and RAMIG (OR 1.30; 95% CI 1.17\u20131.45). For esophagectomy, long-term survival was associated with both TO (hazard ratio [HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.60\u20130.67) and RAMIE (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.84\u20131.00). For gastrectomy, long-term survival was associated with TO (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.56\u20130.60) and both LAMIG (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.85\u20130.94) and RAMIG (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.81\u20130.96). Subset analysis in high-volume centers confirmed similar findings. Despite potentially adverse learning curve effects and more advanced tumor stages captured during the study period, both RAMIE and RAMIG performed in mostly high-volume centers were associated with improved TO and long-term survival. Therefore, consideration for wider adoption but a well-designed phase 3 randomized controlled trial (RCT) is required for a full evaluation of the benefits conferred by robotic techniques for esophageal and gastric cancers.","authors":"S.

We determined the trends in adoption of minimally invasive surgery and 5-year overall survival outcomes after open, laparoscopic-assisted, and robotic-assisted hysterectomy for stage II uterine cancer with cervical stromal involvement. Methods Data for patients with stage II uterine cancer were acquired from the National Cancer Database from 2010 to 2015. \u03c72 testing, Kaplan\u2013Meier methods, and Cox models were used for statistical analyses. Results Of 2949 patients, 44.3% underwent open hysterectomy, 13.9% underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy, and 41.8% underwent robotic hysterectomy. The proportion of robotic cases increased from 26.8% in 2010 to 48.3% in 2015 (annual percent change 10.1%), with a decrease in open hysterectomy from 63.3% to 34.3% (annual percent change \u201312.5%). The overall 5-year survival was 77.6% in robotic, 76.8% in laparoscopic, and 72.5% in open hysterectomy (p=0.045); however, after adjusting for known prognostic factors, robotic (HR 1.00, 95%\u2009CI 0.82 to 1.21; p=0.97) and laparoscopic hysterectomy (HR 1.09, 95%\u2009CI 0.83 to 1.44; p=0.54) did not portend for improved survival compared with open hysterectomy. Black women (HR 1.59, 95%\u2009CI 1.25 to 2.02; p<0.001) and individuals with co-morbidities (HR 1.45, 95%\u2009CI 1.21 to 1.75, p<0.001) had worse adjusted survival and the highest rates of open hysterectomy. Conclusion The use of minimally invasive surgery for stage II uterine cancer has increased over time, with comparable adjusted 5-year survival after robotic or laparoscopic hysterectomy compared with open hysterectomy. Black women and those with co-morbidities had lowest rates of minimally invasive surgery and the poorest adjusted survival.","authors":"M. K. Abel, J. Chan, S. Chow, K. Darcy, C. Tian, D. Kapp, A.

This is especially true for the robotic approach and is one of the main reasons that has prevented its wider acceptance among hospitals and surgeons. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes and economic impact of robotic and open liver surgery in a single institution. Methods: Sixty-eight robotic and 55 open hepatectomies were performed at our institution between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2013. Demographics, perioperative data, and postoperative outcomes were collected and compared between the two groups. An independent company performed the financial analysis. The economic parameters comprised direct variable costs, direct fixed costs, and indirect costs. Results: Mean estimated blood loss was significantly less in the robotic group (438 versus 727.8\u2009mL; P\u2009=\u2009.038). Overall morbidity was significantly lower in the robotic group (22% versus 40%; P\u2009=\u2009.047). Clavien III\/IV complications were also lower, with 4.4% in the robotic versus 16.3% in the open group (P\u2009=\u2009.043). The length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) was shorter for patients who underwent a robotic procedure (2.1 versus 3.3 days; P\u2009=\u2009.004). The average total cost, including readmissions, was $37,518 for robotic surgery and $41,948 for open technique. Conclusions: Robotic liver resections had less overall morbidity, ICU, and hospital stay. This translates into decreased average costs for robotic surgery. These procedures are financially comparable to open resections and do not represent a financial burden to the hospital.","authors":"D. Daskalaki, Raquel Gonzalez-Heredia, Marc Brown, F. Bianco, I.

In this study, we report our experience in robotic lobectomy for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer, with particular attention to oncological outcomes and nodal upstaging rate. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent lobectomy and radical lymphadenectomy at our Institute between 2016 and 2020. We selected 299 patients who met the inclusion criteria of the study. We analyzed the demographic features of the groups as well as their nodal upstaging rate after pathological examination. Then, we analyzed disease-free and overall survival of the entire enrolled patient population and we compared the same oncological outcomes in the upstaging and the non-upstaging group. Results: A total of 299 patients who underwent robotic lobectomy were enrolled. After surgery, 55 patients reported nodal hilar or mediastinal upstaging. The 3-year overall survival of the entire population was 82.8%. The upstaging group and the non-upstaging group were homogeneous for age, gender, smoking habits, clinical stage, tumor site, tumor histology. The non-upstaging group had better OS (p = 0.004) and DFS (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Our results show that robotic surgery is a safe and feasible approach for the treatment of early-stage NSCLC, especially for its accuracy in mediastinal lymphadenectomy. The oncological outcomes were encouraging and consistent with previous findings.","authors":"F. Gallina, Riccardo Taj\u00e8, D. Forcella, Felicita Corzani, V. Cerasoli, P. Visca, C. Coccia, F.

However, patients undergoing robotic colorectal surgery were more frequently male (P = 0.004) with earlier T stage tumours (P = 0.02) if cancer present. Procedures took longer in cases of robotic surgery (302 vs 130 min; P < 0.001), and patients in this group were more frequently admitted to intensive care units (P < 0.001). Overall length of stay was longer (7 vs 5 days; P = 0.03) and consumable cost was A$2728 higher per patient in the robotic surgery group.Conclusion Robotic colorectal surgery appears to be safe compared with current laparoscopic techniques, albeit with longer procedure times and overall length of stay, more frequent intensive care admissions and higher consumables cost.What is known about the topic?Robotic surgery is an emerging alternative to traditional laparoscopic approaches in colorectal surgery. International trials suggest the two techniques are equivalent in safety.What does this paper add?This is an original cohort study examining clinical outcomes in Australian colorectal robotic surgery. The data suggest it may be safe, but this paper demonstrates key issues in the implementation and audit of novel surgical technologies in relatively low-volume centres.What are implications for practitioners?In our study, patients undergoing robotic colorectal surgery at a single centre in Australia had equivalent measured clinical outcomes to those undergoing laparoscopic surgery. However, practitioners may counsel patients that robotic procedures are typically longer and more expensive, with a longer overall hospital admission and a higher likelihood of intensive care admission.","authors":"B.

However, the alignment concept that most effectively enhances patient satisfaction remains unclear. This study compares the clinical outcomes of patients who underwent functionally aligned RTKA (FA-RTKA), mechanically aligned conventional TKA (MA-CTKA) and mechanically aligned RTKA (MA-RTKA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nA prospectively collected database was retrospectively reviewed for patients who underwent primary TKA for knee osteoarthritis. One hundred and forty-seven knees were performed with MA-CTKA, followed by 72 consecutive knees performed with MA-RTKA, and subsequently, 70 consecutive knees performed with FA-RTKA were enrolled. After 1:1 propensity score matching of patient demographics, 70 knees were finally included in each group. The extent of additional soft tissue release during surgery was identified, and the Coronal Plane Alignment of the Knee classification was utilised to categorise the alignment. At the 1-year follow-up, patient-reported outcomes, including the pain Visual Analogue Scale, Knee Society Score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index and Forgotten Joint Score-12, were also compared among the groups.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe FA-RTKA group showed significantly less additional soft tissue release than the MA-CTKA and MA-RTKA groups (15.7%, 38.6% and 35.7%, respectively; p\u2009=\u20090.006). Statistically significant differences in functional scores were observed in the postoperative 1-year clinical outcomes in favour of the FA-RTKA group, which had a significantly larger percentage of knees that maintained constitutional alignment and joint line obliquity than those of the other groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFunctionally aligned TKA showed superior 1-year postoperative patient-reported outcomes compared with those of conventional and robotic arm-assisted mechanically aligned TKA. Therefore, the advantage of RTKA is maximised when the implant positioning is based on functional alignment. The application of RTKA with mechanical alignment has been proven ineffective in improving the clinical outcomes of patients.\n\n\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE\nLevel III.","authors":"Jong Hwa Lee, Seungcheol Kwon, J.

With the recent introduction of new robotic platforms, several studies reported the feasibility of different surgical procedures. The aim of this systematic review is to highlight the current clinical practice with the new robotic platforms in general surgery. Materials and Methods: A grey literature search was performed on the Internet to identify the available robotic systems. A PRISMA compliant systematic review was conducted for all English articles up to 10 February 2023 searching the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. Clinical outcomes, training process, operating surgeon background, cost-analysis, and specific registries were evaluated. Results: A total of 103 studies were included for qualitative synthesis after the full-text screening. Of the fifteen robotic platforms identified, only seven were adopted in a clinical environment. Out of 4053 patients, 2819 were operated on with a new robotic device. Hepatopancreatobiliary surgery specialty performed the majority of procedures, and the most performed procedure was cholecystectomy. Globally, 109 emergency surgeries were reported. Concerning the training process, only 45 papers reported the background of the operating surgeon, and only 28 papers described the training process on the surgical platform. Only one cost-analysis compared a new robot to the existing reference. Two manufacturers promoted a specific registry to collect clinical outcomes. Conclusions: This systematic review highlights the feasibility of most surgical procedures in general surgery using the new robotic platforms. Adoption of these new devices in general surgery is constantly growing with the extension of regulatory approvals. Standardization of the training process and the assessment of skills\u2019 transferability is still lacking.

This study aimed to analyze the early clinical outcomes of patients undergoing totally endoscopic robotic MV repair (TERMVR) as a landmark national study for this procedure.Methods\u2004and\u2004Results:A total of 213 patients (152 men; mean age, 55\u00b111 years) underwent TERMVR during May 2014 to December 2018. Preoperative demographics, operative profiles, and postoperative outcomes, including follow-up echocardiography, were analyzed. Successful TERMVR was achieved in all patients. Operation, cardiopulmonary bypass, and aortic cross-clamp times were 192\u00b149.8, 127\u00b123.8, and 70.1\u00b116.2 min, respectively. Intraoperative transfusion was performed in 20 patients (10%). There were no in-hospital deaths. All patients were alive during the median follow-up period of 255 days (interquartile range, 32.5-208 days). Freedom from recurrence of MR >grade 2+ was 97.3%, 95.0%, and 90.7% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTERMVR is an effective and safe procedure with acceptable early postoperative outcomes.","authors":"T.

Among 39 patients who underwent the pancreatoduodenectomy, the average operative time was 395.3\u00b1118.8 min, and the mean intra-operative blood loss was 447.3\u00b1269.9 mL. Among 31 patients who underwent the distal pancreatectomy (DP), the average operative time was 185.5\u00b174.1 min, and the mean intra-operative blood loss was 267.1\u00b1305.3 mL. In two patients who received the middle pancreatectomy (MP), the average operative time was 225 min and mean intra-operative blood loss was 100 mL. Among all the 72 patients, an average of 4.2\u00b12.6 lymph nodes were dissected, with an average hospital stay of 22.6\u00b110.7 days. Complications were observed in 18 patients, which included pancreatic fistula (n=11), bile leak (n=5), anastomotic bleeding (n=2), pancreatic fistula complicated with portal vein thrombosis (n=1), and anastomotic bleeding complicated with acute renal failure (n=1). Except that one patient died due to post-operative bleeding and acute renal failure, all the other patients were cured after conservative treatment. These 72 patients were followed for 1-45 (15.6\u00b15.8) months, during which 10 patients died. Eleven patients suffered from recurrence or metastasis, among which 6 had local recurrence, 4 had liver metastasis, and 1 had ascites accompnaied with incision site tumor metastasis.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRadical resection of PDAC by robotic surgical system is safe and feasible. It has less surgical trauma and enables faster post-operative recovery, and therefore can achieve the lymph node dissection scope and tumor resection margin required by the standards of radical resection for pancreatic cancer. Nevertheless, its long-term efficacy requires further validation.","authors":"Q.

These results were compared with a cohort of patients who underwent TKA without robotic assistance performed by the same surgeon prior to the introduction of this technology. Materials and Methods\u2003A cohort of consecutive patients undergoing primary TKA for the diagnosis of osteoarthritis by a single fellowship trained orthopaedic surgeon over a 39-month period was identified. Patients who underwent TKA during the year that this surgeon transitioned his entire knee arthroplasty practice to robotic assistance were excluded to eliminate selection bias and control for the learning curve. All patients received the same prosthesis and postoperative pain protocol. Patients that required intubation for failed spinal anesthetic were excluded. A final population of 492 TKAs was identified. Of these, 290 underwent TKA without robotic assistance and 202 underwent robotic arm-assisted TKA. Patient demographic characteristics and short-term clinical data were analyzed. Results\u2003Robotic arm-assisted TKA was associated with shorter length of stay (2.3 vs. 2.6 days, p\u2009<\u20090.001), a 50% reduction in morphine milligram equivalent utilization (from 214 to 103, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and a mean increase in procedure time of 9.3\u2009minutes (p\u2009<\u20090.001). There was one superficial infection in the nonrobotic cohort and there were no deep postoperative infections in either cohort. There were no manipulations under anesthesia in the robotic cohort while there were six in the nonrobotic cohort. Additionally, there were no significant differences in emergency department visits, readmissions, or return to the operating room. Conclusion\u2003This analysis corroborates existing literature suggesting that robotic arm-assisted TKA can be correlated with improved short-term clinical outcomes. This study reports on a single surgeon's experience with regard to analgesic requirements, length of stay, pain scores, and procedure time following a complete transition to robotic arm-assisted TKA. These results underscore the importance of continued evaluation of clinical outcomes as robotic arthroplasty technology continues to grow.","authors":"C. King, Mark L. Jordan, Alexander T.

A systematic review and meta-analysis","abstract":"Background Robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) is an emerging technology that claims to position implants with very high accuracy. However, there is currently limited data in literature on whether this improved accuracy leads to better long-term clinical outcomes. This systematic review compares the outcomes of THA done with the help of robotic assistance (RA) to those done with conventional manual techniques (MTs). Methods Four electronic databases were searched for eligible articles that directly compared robot-assisted THA to manual THA and had data on the radiological or clinical outcomes of both. Data on various outcome parameters were collected. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model with 95% CIs. Results A total of 17 articles were found eligible for inclusion, and 3600 cases were analysed. Mean operating time in the RA group was significantly longer than in the MT group. RA resulted in significantly more acetabular cups being placed inside Lewinnek\u2019s and Callanan\u2019s safe zones (p<0.001) and had significantly reduced limb length discrepancy compared with MT. There were no statistically significant differences in the two groups in terms of incidence of perioperative complications, need for revision surgery and long-term functional outcome. Conclusion RA leads to highly accurate implant placement and leads to significantly reduced limb length discrepancies. However, the authors do not recommend robot-assisted techniques for routine THAs due to lack of adequate long-term follow-up data, prolonged surgical times and no significant differences in the rate of complications and implant survivorship compared with conventional MTs.","authors":"Vishal Kumar, Sandeep Patel, V.

Methods: a search of the studies comparing robotic and laparoscopic or open esophagectomy was performed trough the medical libraries, with the search string \u201crobotic and (oesophagus OR esophagus OR esophagectomy OR oesophagectomy)\u201d. Outcomes were: postoperative complications rate (anastomotic leakage, bleeding, wound infection, pneumonia, recurrent laryngeal nerves paralysis, chylotorax, mortality), intraoperative outcomes (mean blood loss, operative time and conversion), oncologic outcomes (harvested nodes, R0 resection, recurrence) and recovery outcomes (length of hospital stay). Results: Robotic approach is superior to open surgery in terms of blood loss p = 0.001, wound infection rate, p = 0.002, pneumonia rate, p = 0.030 and mean number of harvested nodes, p < 0.0001 and R0 resection rate, p = 0.043. Similarly, robotic approach is superior to conventional laparoscopy in terms of mean number of harvested nodes, p = 0.001 pneumonia rate, p = 0.003. Conclusions: robotic surgery could be considered superior to both open surgery and conventional laparoscopy. These encouraging results should promote the diffusion of the robotic surgery, with the creation of randomized trials to overcome selection bias.","authors":"M. Manigrasso, S. Vertaldi, A.

As we know, the ROLARR randomized clinical trial (RCT), the biggest international multicenter RCT comparing the effect of robotic-assisted vs conventional laparoscopic for rectal cancer, did not find any significant differences in the risk of conversion to open laparotomy and postoperative complications between groups. In addition, a large retrospective single-center comparative study from China also showed similar short-term outcomes between roboticassisted surgery (n 1\u20444 556) and laparoscopic group (n 1\u20444 1029). On the contrast, using large sample size and including the consecutive rectal cancer patients, the authors concluded that robotic rectal cancer surgery improved the short-term outcomes when compared with laparoscopic surgery. The appearance of the present study is of great significance to surgeons performing rectal cancer surgery. However, the discussion on why the above phenomenon occurs in the present study seems to be lacking. In addition, we have the following comments. First, the consecutive inclusion of all rectal cancer patients may decrease the selection bias in a degree. However, the authors seem to miss the effect of the learning curve on robotic surgery. Based on 506 cases of robotic rectal cancer surgery performed by a single surgeon, Lee concluded that surgical outcomes improved after the 177th case. In the present study, the authors did not describe the surgeons who performed the 317 cases of robotic surgery.

This study describes the cortical and pedicle screw accuracy for the first 54 cases where navigated robotic assistance was used in a surgical setting. This is a retrospective chart review of the initial 54 patients undergoing spine surgery with pedicle and cortical screws using robotic guidance with navigation. A computed tomography (CT)-based Gertzbein and Robbins System (GRS) was used to classify pedicle screw accuracy. Screw tip, tail, and angulation offsets were measured using image overlay analysis. Screw malposition, reposition, and return to operating room rates were collected. 1 of the first 54 cases was a revision surgery and was excluded from the study. Ten screws were placed without the robot due to surgeon discretion and were excluded for the data analysis of 292 screws. Only 0.68% (2\/292) of the robot-assisted screws was repositioned based on surgeon discretion. Based on the GRS CT-based grading, 98.3% (287\/292) were graded A or B, 1.0% (3\/292) screws were graded C, and only 0.7% (2\/292) screws was graded D. The average offset from preoperative plan to actual final placement was 1.9\u00a0mm from the tip, 2.3\u00a0mm from the tail, and 2.8\u00b0 of angulation.

Minimally invasive gastrectomy is currently considered a valid option to treat gastric cancer and is gaining increasing acceptance. Recent reports have suggested that the application of robots may confer some advantages over conventional laparoscopy, but the role of robotic surgery in clinical practice is still uncertain. We aimed to critically review the relevant evidence comparing robotic to standard laparoscopic surgery in performing radical gastrectomy. Methods. The Pubmed\/Medline electronic databases were searched through February 2021. Paper conference and the English language was the only restriction applied to our search strategy. Results. According to the existing data, robotic gastrectomy seems to provide some benefits in terms of blood loss, rate of conversion, procedure-specific postoperative morbidity, and length of hospital stay. Robotic gastrectomy is also associated with a longer duration of surgery and a higher economic burden as compared to its laparoscopic counterpart. No significant differences have been disclosed in terms of long-term survivals, while the number of lymph nodes retrieved with robotic gastrectomy is generally higher than that of laparoscopy. Conclusions. The current literature suggests that robotic radical gastrectomy appears as competent as the conventional laparoscopic procedure and may provide some clinical advantages. However, due to the relative paucity of high-level evidence, it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions.","authors":"G. Giuliani, F. Guerra, L. de Franco, L. Salvischiani, Roberto Benigni, A.

Dedicated centers have continuously evolved and further developed this minimally invasive method of coronary bypass surgery. A literature review was conducted to assess intra- and postoperative outcomes of TECAB. PubMed returned 19 comprehensive articles on TECAB. Investigation was focused on perioperative outcome parameters, i.e.: operative time, conversion to larger incision, revision for bleeding, atrial fibrillation, stroke, acute renal failure, and mortality. Outcome from the analysis of 2,397 reported cases showed an average operative time of 291 \u00b1 57 minutes (range 112 to 1,050), conversion rate to larger incisions at 11.5%, and perioperative mortality at 0.8%. Pooled data demonstrated 4.2% operative revision rate due to postoperative hemorrhage, 1.0% stroke incidence, 1.6% acute renal failure, and 13.3% de novo atrial fibrillation. The mean length of hospital stay measured 5.8 \u00b1 1.7 days. Conversion rates and operative times decreased over time. According to data in the literature, coronary bypass surgery carried out in completely endoscopic fashion utilizing robotic assistance can require relatively extensive operative times and conversion rates are somewhat higher than in other robotic cardiac surgery. However, major postoperative events lie in an acceptable range. TECAB remains the surgical revascularization method with the least tissue trauma and represents an opportunity for coronary artery bypass grafting via port access. Rates of major complications are at least similar to conventional surgical access procedures.","authors":"L. G\u00f6b\u00f6l\u00f6s, Jehad Ramahi, A. Obeso, T. Bartel, M. Hogan, M.

Leonardo designed, and possibly built, the first articulated humanoid robot in 1495 in Milan (Italy) [1], but the term robot was coined only in 1921 by Karel \u010capek, who staged a play with artificial people (\u201crobota\u201d) working for humans in a factory [2]. Indeed, robots embody one of the main human dreams: having machines replacing man in dangerous or heavy tasks. In keeping with this hope, robots are machines conceived to aid, augment, or substitute humans. Starting from the last two decades of the twentieth century, laparoscopy allowed surgeons to perform many procedures formerly requiring large incisions (i.e., open surgery) through keyhole openings, thus proportionally reducing surgical trauma. In open surgery, relatively large incisions are required to achieve good exposure of the surgical site and confidently address diseased tissues. Laparoscopic surgery (LS) not only made this possible, but also improved clinical outcomes and became the standard technique for many surgical procedures. However, implementation of conventional LS was limited in some complex operations, such as pancreatoduodenectomy or resection of hilar cholangiocarcinoma because of bidimensional vision, loss of hand\u2013eye alignment, use of rigid instruments with a fulcrum effect and only 4 degrees of freedom, and poor surgeon ergonomics [3]. Robotic surgery, as provided by the da Vinci Surgical System (dVSS) (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), has been the following revolution in surgery, because this system was specifically designed to address most of the technical limitations of conventional LS. The dVss is a master\u2013slave telemanipulator that faithfully reproduces the movements of surgeon\u2019s hands at tip of miniaturized intracorporeal instruments with seven degrees of freedom. Hand\u2013eye coordination is also restored, thanks to an immersive view of the operative field that reproduces the natural alignment between vision, hands, and instruments. When all these features are taken together, the use of a dVSS restores the dexterity of open surgery in minimally invasive operations [4]. The dVSS was initially developed in the context of a military project of telesurgery, aiming to permit a remote surgeon to operate on wounded soldiers on a battlefield. The first robotic system was indeed integrated into a combat vehicle in 1994, and the first ex-vivo telesurgery procedure was performed during a combat exercise [5]. The first human operation, a cholecystectomy, was performed on March 3, 1997 by Himpens and Cadi\u00e8re [6]. In parallel with the dVSS, Zeus\u00ae, another robotic system, was developed by a competing company (Computer Motion\u00ae), but after several surgical procedures, this project was ended in 2003 when Computer Motion\u00ae merged with Intuitive Surgical\u00ae. Several components of Zeus\u00ae were integrated in the subsequent versions of the dVSS. The first dVSS was sold to the Leipzig Heart Center in Germany in late 1998. The device obtained FDA clearance in 2000 [2]. Table 1 reports several first-ever robotic abdominal procedures performed using the dVSS. Time distribution of these procedures demonstrates that in 2003, only 3 years after FDA clearance, there was a peak in the number of reported new robotic operations, demonstrating quick uptake and confident use of the new technology in several different areas. It is also worth to note that some of these procedures were truly complex, such as distal splenopancreatectomy, pancreatoduodenectomy, total gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy, rectal anterior resection, transhiatal esophagectomy, right extended hepatectomy, and radical cystectomy with intra-abdominal formation of orthotopic ileal neobladder.

Review Methods Articles in the database were reviewed for inclusion by 2 independent reviewers according to predetermined eligibility criteria. The references of relevant articles were then hand-searched to identify additional manuscripts. For included articles, the study characteristics and relevant data were extracted. Results Of 103 articles screened, 20 reporting validated measures of QOL and\/or swallow outcomes for 659 patients were eligible for inclusion. Fourteen were observational studies or case series and did not compare the TORS group with another intervention. Two were prospective nonrandomized clinical trials that compared outcomes between TORS and primary chemoradiation. Four were cohort studies comparing TORS with other treatment approaches and modalities, including open surgical approaches and transoral laser microsurgery. Overall, most patients who underwent TORS \u00b1 adjuvant therapy reported a return to baseline QOL and swallow function by 6 to 12 months posttreatment. Several studies demonstrated superior QOL and swallowing outcomes when compared with primary chemoradiation or open approaches.

Thus, there is a need to identify the benefits from RG and its specific candidates. This retrospective study analyzed data from a prospectively collected clinical database at our center. Data of patients with primary gastric cancer undergoing either robotic or laparoscopic radical gastrectomy from June 2014 to June 2020 were reviewed. Surgical outcomes were compared between the two groups, and multivariable analyses were performed to elucidate the relevant factors for postoperative complications in several subgroups. A total of 1172 patients were divided into those who underwent RG (n\u2009=\u2009152) and those who underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) (n\u2009=\u20091020). Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups, except the RG group included more patients undergoing total\/proximal gastrectomy (TG\/PG) and patients at clinical stage III. Compared with the LG group, the RG group had lower incidences of postoperative complications\u2009\u2265\u2009Clavien-Dindo grade III (2\/152 (1.3%) versus 72\/1020 (7.1%); P\u2009=\u20090.004), and intraabdominal complications\u2009\u2265\u2009grade II (6\/152 (3.9%) versus 119\/1020 (11.7%); P\u2009=\u20090.004). Multivariable analysis revealed that RG was a significant relevant factor for reducing overall postoperative complications (\u2265\u2009grade III) (odds ratio (OR) 0.16, P\u2009=\u20090.013), and intraabdominal complications (\u2265\u2009grade II) (OR 0.29, P\u2009=\u20090.002).

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted comparing consecutively performed robotic-assisted and laparoscopic proctectomy with IPAA between 1 January 2016 and 31 September 2021. In total, 67 adult patients with medically refractory UC without proven dysplasia or carcinoma underwent surgery: 29 operated robotically and 38 laparoscopically.

Robotic surgical systems have dramatically changed minimally invasive surgery. Three-dimensional, magnified and stable view, articulated instruments, and reduction of physiologic tremors leading to superior dexterity and ergonomics. Therefore, robotic platforms could potentially address limitations of laparoscopic rectal surgery. It was aimed at reviewing current literature on short-term clinical and oncological (pathological) outcomes after robotic rectal cancer surgery in comparison with laparoscopic surgery. A systematic review was performed for the period 2002 to 2014. A total of 1776 patients with rectal cancer underwent minimally invasive robotic treatment in 32 studies. After robotic and laparoscopic approach to oncologic rectal surgery, respectively, mean operating time varied from 192-385 min, and from 158-297 min; mean estimated blood loss was between 33 and 283 mL, and between 127 and 300 mL; mean length of stay varied from 4-10 d; and from 6-15 d. Conversion after robotic rectal surgery varied from 0% to 9.4%, and from 0 to 22% after laparoscopy. There was no difference between robotic (0%-41.3%) and laparoscopic (5.5%-29.3%) surgery regarding morbidity and anastomotic complications (respectively, 0%-13.5%, and 0%-11.1%). Regarding immediate oncologic outcomes, respectively among robotic and laparoscopic cases, positive circumferential margins varied from 0% to 7.5%, and from 0% to 8.8%; the mean number of retrieved lymph nodes was between 10 and 20, and between 11 and 21; and the mean distal resection margin was from 0.8 to 4.7 cm, and from 1.9 to 4.5 cm. Robotic rectal cancer surgery is being undertaken by experienced surgeons. However, the quality of the assembled evidence does not support definite conclusions about most studies variables. Robotic rectal cancer surgery is associated to increased costs and operating time. It also seems to be associated to reduced conversion rates. Other short-term outcomes are comparable to conventional laparoscopy techniques, if not better. Ultimately, pathological data evaluation suggests that oncologic safety may be preserved after robotic total mesorectal excision. However, further studies are required to evaluate oncologic safety and functional results.","authors":"S. Ara\u00fajo, V. Seid, S.

Such innovations are ever-growing and have now reached the field of cochlear implantation. To implement robotic ear surgery in routine, it is of interest if preoperative planning of a safe trajectory to the middle ear is possible with clinically available image data. Methods: We evaluated the feasibility of robotic cochlear implant surgery in 50 patients (100 ears) scheduled for routine cochlear implant procedures based on clinically available imaging. The primary objective was to assess if available high-resolution computed tomography or cone beam tomography imaging is sufficient for planning a trajectory by an otological software. Secondary objectives were to assess the feasibility of cochlear implant surgery with a drill bit diameter of 1.8 mm, which is the currently used as a standard drill bit. Furthermore, it was evaluated if feasibility of robotic surgery could be increased when using smaller drill bit sizes. Cochlear and trajectory parameters of successfully planned ears were collected. Measurements were carried out by two observers and the interrater reliability was assessed using Cohen's Kappa. Results: Under the prerequisite of the available image data being sufficient for the planning of the procedure, up to two thirds of ears were eligible for robotic cochlear implant surgery with the standard drill bit size of 1.8 mm. The main reason for inability to plan the keyhole access was insufficient image resolution causing anatomical landmarks not being accurately identified. Although currently not applicable in robotic cochlear implantation, narrower drill bit sizes ranging from 1.0 to 1.7 mm in diameter could increase feasibility up to 100%. The interrater agreement between the two observers was good for this data set. Discussion: For robotic cochlear implant surgery, imaging with sufficient resolution is essential for preoperative assessment. A slice thickness of <0.3 mm is necessary for trajectory planning. This can be achieved by using digital volume tomography while radiation exposure can be kept to a minimum. Furthermore, surgeons who use the software tool, should be trained on a regular basis in order to achieve planning consistency.","authors":"A. Auinger, V. Dahm, R. Liepins, D. Riss, W.

We aimed to compare deviations between implant planning and placement with the assistance of dynamic computer-assisted implant surgery (d-CAIS) or autonomous robotic computer-assisted implant surgery (r-CAIS) methods in a clinical setting.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe retrospective analysis of medical records between 2021 July and 2022 December was conducted to compare the implantation accuracy of the d-CAIS and r-CAIS system in partially edentulous patients through cone-beam computed tomography. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were recorded using a visual analogue scale (VAS). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to check the data distribution. Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test was used as appropriate, with a defined significant difference (p\u2009<\u2009.05).\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeventy-seven patients were analysed (124 implants), with 38 patients (62 implants) in the d-CAIS group and 39 patients (62 implants) in the r-CAIS group. The differences between d-CAIS and r-CAIS were 4.09\u2009\u00b1\u20091.79\u00b0 versus 1.37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.92\u00b0 (p\u2009<\u2009.001) in angular deviation; 1.25\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 versus 0.68\u2009\u00b1\u20090.36\u2009mm (p\u2009<\u2009.001) in coronal global deviation; 1.39\u2009\u00b1\u20090.52 versus 0.69\u2009\u00b1\u20090.36\u2009mm (p\u2009<\u2009.001) in apical global deviation; the results of the PROMs showed no statistical difference between the two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nr-CAIS allows more accurate implant placement than the d-CAIS technology.

We conducted a literature search to identify publications of robotic surgical procedures in all specialties performed with either ELS or robotic staplers. Twenty-nine manuscripts and six abstracts with relevant information on operative outcomes published from January 2011 to September 2017 were identified. Given the relatively recent market release of robotic staplers in 2014, comparative perioperative clinical outcomes data on the performance of ELS vs. robotic staplers in robotic surgery is very sparse in the published literature. Only three comparative studies of surgeries with the da Vinci robotic system plus ELS vs. da Vinci plus robotic staplers were identified; two in robotic colorectal surgery and the other in robotic gastric bypass surgery. These comparative studies illustrate some nuances in device design and usability, which may impact outcomes and cost, and therefore may be important to consider when selecting the appropriate stapling technologies\/technique for different robotic surgeries. Comparative perioperative data on the use of ELS vs. robotic staplers in robotic surgery is scarce (three studies), and current literature identifies both types of devices as safe and effective. Given the longer clinical history of ELS and its relatively more robust evidence base, there may be trade-offs to consider before switching to robotic staplers in certain robotic procedures.

It is important to know whether the existing open or laparoscopic skills of robotic novices shorten the robotic surgery learning curve, potentially reducing the amount of training required. This systematic review aims to assess psychomotor skill transfer to the robot in clinical and simulated settings. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Scopus databases were systematically searched in accordance with PRISMA guidelines from inception to August 2021 alongside website searching and citation chaining. Article screening, data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken by two independent reviewers. Outcomes included simulator performance metrics or in the case of clinical studies, peri- and post-operative metrics. Twenty-nine studies met the eligibility criteria. All studies were judged to be at high or moderate overall risk of bias. Results were narratively synthesised due to heterogeneity in study designs and outcome measures. Two of the three studies assessing open surgical skill transfer found evidence of successful skill transfer while nine of twenty-seven studies evaluating laparoscopic skill transfer found no evidence. Skill transfer from both modalities is most apparent when advanced robotic tasks are performed in the initial phase of the learning curve but quality and methodological limitations of the existing literature prevent definitive conclusions. The impact of incorporating laparoscopic simulation into robotic training curricula and on the cost effectiveness of training should be investigated.","authors":"B. Chahal, A.

The optimal management of early-stage OPSCC with surgery or radiation continues to be a clinical controversy. Long-term randomized data comparing these paradigms are lacking. METHODS We randomly assigned patients with T1-T2, N0-2 (\u2264 4 cm) OPSCC to radiotherapy (RT) (with chemotherapy if N1-2) versus transoral robotic surgery plus neck dissection (TORS + ND) (with or without adjuvant therapy). The primary end point was swallowing quality of life (QOL) at 1-year using the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory. Secondary end points included adverse events, other QOL outcomes, overall survival, and progression-free survival. All analyses were intention-to-treat. Herein, we present long-term outcomes from the trial. RESULTS Sixty-eight patients were randomly assigned (n = 34 per arm) between August 10, 2012, and June 9, 2017. Median follow-up was 45 months. Longitudinal MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory analyses demonstrated statistical superiority of RT arm over time (P = .049), although the differences beyond 1 year were of smaller magnitude than at the 1-year timepoint (year 2: 86.0 \u00b1 13.5 in the RT arm v 84.8 \u00b1 12.5 in the TORS + ND arm, P = .74; year 3: 88.9 \u00b1 11.3 v 83.3 \u00b1 13.9, P = .12). These differences did not meet the threshold to qualify as a clinically meaningful change at any timepoint. Certain differences in QOL concerns including more pain and dental concerns in the TORS + ND arm seen at 1 year resolved at 2 and 3 years; however, TORS patients started to use more nutritional supplements at 3 years (P = .015). Dry mouth scores were higher in RT patients over time (P = .041). CONCLUSION On longitudinal analysis, the swallowing QOL difference between primary RT and TORS + ND approaches persists but decreases over time. Patients with OPSCC should be informed about the pros and cons of both treatment options (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01590355).","authors":"A. Nichols, J. Theurer, E. Prisman, N. Read, E.

A systematic review of the literature","abstract":"A crucial element of any surgical training program is the ability to provide procedure-specific, objective, and reliable measures of performance. During robotic surgery, objective clinically relevant performance metrics (CRPMs) can provide tailored contextual feedback and correlate with clinical outcomes. This review aims to define CRPMs, assess their validity in robotic surgical training and compare CRPMs to existing measures of robotic performance. A systematic search of Medline and Embase databases was conducted in May 2022 following the PRISMA guidelines. The search terms included Clinically Relevant Performance Metrics (CRPMs) OR Clinically Relevant Outcome Measures (CROMs) AND robotic surgery. The study settings, speciality, operative context, study design, metric details, and validation status were extracted and analysed. The initial search yielded 116 citations, of which 6 were included. Citation searching identified 3 additional studies, resulting in 9 studies included in this review. Metrics were defined as CRPMs, CROMs, proficiency-based performance metrics and reference-procedure metrics which were developed using a modified Delphi methodology. All metrics underwent both contents and construct validation. Two studies found a strong correlation with GEARS but none correlated their metrics with patient outcome data. CRPMs are a validated and objective approach for assessing trainee proficiency. Evaluating CRPMs with other robotic-assessment tools will facilitate a multimodal metric evaluation approach to robotic surgery training. Further studies should assess the correlation with clinical outcomes. This review highlights there is significant scope for the development and validation of CRPMs to establish proficiency-based progression curricula that can be translated from a simulation setting into clinical practice.","authors":"Melissa M.

There remains controversy about the overall benefit of robotic-assisted (RBS) compared to conventional laparoscopic (LBS) bariatric surgery. In this study, we used a large national risk-stratified bariatric clinical database to compare outcomes between robotic and laparoscopic gastric bypass (RNYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Methods A retrospective analysis of the 2015 and 2016 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) Participant Use Data File (PUF) was performed. Primary robotic and laparoscopic RYNGB and SG were analyzed. Descriptive analysis was performed of the unmatched cohorts, followed by 1:3 case-controlled matching. Cases and controls were matched by patient demographics and pre-operative comorbidities, and peri-operative outcomes compared. Results 77,991 Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RnYGB) (7.5% robotic-assisted) and 189,503 SG (6.8% robotic-assisted) cases were identified. Operative length was significantly higher in both the robotic-assisted RnYGB and SG cohorts ( p \u2009<\u20090.0001). Outcomes were similar between the robotic-assisted and laparoscopic RnYGB cohorts, except a lower mortality rate ( p \u2009=\u20090.05), transfusion requirement ( p \u2009=\u20090.005), aggregate bleeding ( p \u2009=\u20090.04), and surgical site infections (SSI) ( p \u2009=\u20090.006) in the robotic-assisted cohort. Outcomes were also similar between robotic-assisted and laparoscopic SG, except for a longer length of stay ( p \u2009<\u20090.0001) and higher rates of conversion ( p \u2009<\u20090.0001), 30-day intervention ( p \u2009=\u20090.01), operative drain present ( p \u2009<\u20090.0001), sepsis ( p \u2009=\u20090.01), and organ space SSI ( p \u2009=\u20090.0002) in the robotic cohort. Bleeding was lower in the robotic SG cohort and mortality was similar. Conclusion Both robotic-assisted and laparoscopic RnYGB and SG are overall very safe. Robotic-assisted gastric bypass is associated with a lower mortality and morbidity; however, a clear benefit for robotic-assisted SG compared to laparoscopic SG was not seen.

The network reliability is the foundation of successful implementation of telesurgery. It relies on a robust, high-speed communication network, with ultra-low latency. Significant lag has been shown to endanger precision and safety. Furthermore, the full-fledged adoption of telerobotics demands careful consideration of ethical challenges too. A deep insight into these issues has been investigated during the first Telesurgery Consensus Conference that took place in Orlando, Florida, USA, on the 3rd and 4th of February, 2024. During the Conference, the state of the art of remote surgery has been reported from robotic systems displaying telesurgery potential. The Hinotori, a robotic-assisted surgery platform developed by Medicaroid, experienced remote surgery as pre-clinical testing only; the Edge Medical Company, Shenzen, China, reported more than one hundred animal and 30 live human surgeries; the KanGuo reported human telesurgical cases performed with distances more than 3000 km; the Microport, China, collected more than 100 human operations at a distance up to 5000 km.

TLM reported comparable oncological outcomes and better functional postoperative and rehabilitation outcomes than open partial laryngectomy. TLM is currently considered as the standard surgical approach for early-stage laryngeal carcinoma. However, TLM has many limitations, including the limited view of the surgical field through the laryngoscope, exposure difficulties for some tumor locations, and a long learning curve. The development of transoral robotic surgery (TORS) appears to be an important issue to overcome these limitations. The current robotic technologies used in surgery benefited from the research of the U.S. Military and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the 1970s and 1980s. The first application in humans started in the 2000s with the first robotic-assisted cholecystectomy in the US, performed by a surgeon located in France. The use of robots in otolaryngology occurred after the development of the Da Vinci system in digestive surgery, urology, and gynecology, and mainly concerns cT1-T2 and some selected cT3 oropharyngeal and supraglottic carcinomas. With the development of a new robotic system with smaller arms and instruments, TORS indications will probably evolve in the next few years, leading to better outcomes for laryngeal or hypopharyngeal carcinomas.","authors":"S.

Background: Formal training is recommended for safe introduction of pancreatic surgery but definitions of learning curves vary and have not been standardized. Methods: A systematic search on PubMed, Web of Science, and CENTRAL databases identified studies on learning curves in pancreatic surgery. Primary outcome was the number needed to reach the learning curve as defined by the included studies. Secondary outcomes included endpoints defining learning curves, methods of analysis (statistical\/arbitrary), and classification of learning phases. Results: Out of 1115 articles, 66 studies with 14,206 patients were included. Thirty-five studies (53%) based the learning curve analysis on statistical calculations. Most often used parameters to define learning curves were operative time (n = 51), blood loss (n = 17), and complications (n = 10). The number of procedures to surpass a first phase of learning curve was 30 (20\u201350) for open PD, 39 (11\u201360) for laparoscopic PD, 25 (8\u2013100) for robotic PD (P = 0.521), 16 (3\u201317) for laparoscopic DP, and 15 (5\u201337) for robotic DP (P = 0.914).

However, evidence from the literature regarding its oncological safety and clinical outcomes is still lacking. This brief review summarized the current status of robotic technology in rectal cancer therapy from the perspective of several mainstream surgical methods, including robotic total mesorectal excision (TME), robotic transanal TME, robotic lateral lymph node dissection, and artificial intelligence, focusing on the developmental direction of robotic approach in the field of minimally invasive surgery for rectal cancer in the future.","authors":"Ge Liu, Shoujia Zhang, Yan Zhang, Xiaoqing Fu, Xinlu Liu","year":2022,"url":"https:\/\/www.semanticscholar.org\/paper\/033a6300a3cc9f946565ba11cc70e5d8b7b8db7c"},{"title":"Clinical characteristics and outcomes of HIV-seropositive men treated with surgery for prostate cancer","abstract":null,"authors":"S.

Background New operating room technologies offer potential benefits for patients and staff, yet also present challenges for physical, procedural, team, and organizational integration. Historically, RAS implementation has focused on establishing the technical skills of the surgeon on the console, and has not systematically addressed the new skills required for other team members, the use of the workspace, or the organizational changes. Results Human factors studies of robotic surgery have demonstrated not just the effects of these hidden complexities on people, teams, processes, and proximal outcomes, but also have been able to analyze and explain in detail why they happen and offer methods to address them. We review studies on workload, communication, workflow, workspace, and coordination in robotic surgery, and then discuss the potential for improvement that these studies suggest within the wider healthcare system. Conclusion There is a growing need to understand and develop approaches to safety and quality improvement through human-systems integration at the frontline of care. Precis: The introduction of robotic surgery has exposed under-acknowledged complexities of introducing complex technology into operating rooms. We explore the methodological and practical challenges, provide examples of evidence-based improvements, and discuss the implications for systems engineering and clinical human factors research and practice.","authors":"K.

While associated costs and the limitations regarding instruments for smaller pediatric patients remain relevant issues, surgeon comfort related to ergonomic design in combination with enhanced three-dimensional high-fidelity imaging and tissue handling compared to traditional minimally invasive approached may offer improved surgical and postoperative outcomes. Given that the demand for this innovative technology will likely continue to expand in the field of pediatric surgery, pediatric anesthesiologists will be called upon to provide anesthetic care to patients exposed to this novel surgical technology with its unique features, intraoperative requirements, and potential complications.

Robotic platforms may help the surgeon to overcome the technical difficulties in super-obese (SO, BMI\u2009\u2265\u200950 kg\/m2) patients, in which multi-quadrant operations could be challenging. We aimed to evaluate the effect of robot-assisted (R) versus laparoscopic (L) approaches in Single Anastomosis Duodeno-Ileal Bypass with Sleeve Gastrectomy (SADI-S) and Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) in SO and Super-Super Obese (SSO, BMI\u2009\u2265\u200960 kg\/m2) patients in terms of outcomes and cost-effectiveness. Bariatric procedures performed from 2012 to 2023 were retrospectively reviewed. The inclusion criteria were BMI\u2009\u2265\u200950 kg\/m2, primary SADI-S or RYGB. Operative time (OT), early complications, post-operative stay (POS), overall costs and follow-up data were analyzed. A subgroup analysis for surgical procedures and SSO patients was also performed. Among 4596 patients, 174 RYGB and 91 SADI-S in BMI\u2009\u2265\u200950 kg\/m2 patients were selected. After Propensity Score Matching analysis, two groups of patients were identified (laparoscopic and robot-assisted), each one composed of 18 RYGB and 26 SADI-S. Intraoperative and post-operative complication rates and POS were comparable. Mean OT was longer in robotic procedures compared with laparoscopy (199.1\u2009\u00b1\u200965.7 and 109.5\u2009\u00b1\u200939.1 min, respectively, p\u2009<\u20090.001). The difference in OT was eliminated after only SSO patients were included in the analysis (172.7\u2009\u00b1\u200924.1 vs 152.6\u2009\u00b1\u200926.2 min for R-SADI-S and L-SADI-S, respectively, p\u2009=\u20090.107). Robotic surgeries were associated with higher costs (8134.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091886.7 and 2386.7\u2009\u00b1\u2009388.2 \u20ac in R-RYGB and L-RYGB, respectively; 7996.6\u2009\u00b1\u2009873.1 and 3954.6\u2009\u00b1\u2009631.1 \u20ac in R-SADI-S and L-SADI-S).

The goal of this study is to compare the perioperative outcomes of single port (SP) to multi-port (MP) robotic technology for partial nephrectomy. Materials and Methods This is a prospective cohort study of patients who have undergone robot-assisted partial nephrectomy using SP and MP technology. Baseline demographic, clinical, and tumor-specific characteristics and perioperative outcomes were compared using \u03c7 2, T-test and Mann-Whitney U test in the overall cohort and in a 1:1 propensity score-matched cohort, adjusting for baseline characteristics. Results After propensity matching, 146 SP patients were matched with 146 MP patients. Single port and multiport groups had similar mean age (58 \u00b1 12 years vs. 59 \u00b1 12 years; p =0.606) and proportion of males (54.11% vs. 52.05%; p=0.725). The SP had a longer mean ischemia (18.29 \u00b1 10.49mins vs. 13.79 \u00b1 6.29mins; p <0.001). Estimated blood loss and Length of stay, operative time, positive margin rate and any complication rate were similar between the two groups. Conclusions SP partial nephrectomy had a longer ischemia time, and a comparable LOS, EBL, operative time, positive margin rates and complication rates to multi-port. This early data is encouraging. However, the role of SP requires further study and should evaluate safety and long-term data when compared to the standard multi-port technique.","authors":"K. Okhawere, A.

Objectives To report and compare the application of robotic-assisted navigation with an O-arm or three-dimensional (3D) C-arm-assisted pedicle screw insertion in scoliosis surgery, and compare with free-hand technique. Methods One hundred and forty-four scoliosis patients were included in this study. Ninety-two patients underwent robotic-assisted pedicle screw insertion (Group A), and 52 patients underwent freehand fluoroscopy-guided pedicle screw insertion (Group B). Group A was further divided into Subgroup AI (n = 48; robotic-assisted navigation with an O-arm) and Subgroup AII (n = 44; robotic-assisted navigation with a 3D C-arm). The evaluated clinical outcomes were operation time, blood loss, radiation exposure, postoperative hospital stay, and postoperative complications. The clinical outcomes, coronal and sagittal scoliosis parameters and the accuracy of the pedicle screw placement were assessed. Results There were no significant differences in blood loss and postoperative hospital stay between Groups A and B (P = .406, P = .138, respectively). Radiation exposure for patients in Group A (Subgroups AI or AII) was higher than that in Group B (P < .005), and Subgroup AI had higher patient radiation exposure compared with Subgroup AII (P < .005). The operation time in Subgroup AII was significantly longer than that in Subgroup AI and Group B (P = .016, P = .032, respectively). The proportion of clinically acceptable screws was higher in Group A (Subgroups AI or AII) compared with Group B (P < .005). Conclusions Robotic-assisted navigation with an O-arm or 3D C-arm effectively increased the accuracy and safety in scoliosis surgery. Compared with robotic-assisted navigation with a 3D C-arm, robotic-assisted navigation with an O-arm was more efficient intraoperatively.","authors":"Chao Li, Hao Li, Junxiao Su, Zheng Wang, Donglai Li, Yong\u2010hao Tian, Suomao Yuan, Lianlei Wang, Xinyu Liu","year":2022,"url":"https:\/\/www.semanticscholar.org\/paper\/53bc1de884d51c4306d7513eb8befbb34020aca9"},{"title":"Robotic-assisted thoracic surgery following neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer: A real-world prospective cohort study","abstract":"Objective Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a heterogeneous group of diseases. For this subset of patients, clinical management is still under debate and prognosis remains poor so far. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of robotic-assisted thoracic surgery after neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy in stage III NSCLC. Methods A real-world prospective cohort study was performed in a single-center setting from April 2021 to May 2022. Patients who were diagnosed with resectable or potentially resectable stage IIIA\u2013B NSCLC and received neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy followed by robotic-assisted thoracic surgery were enrolled. Pathological response to neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy, treatment-related adverse events, and surgical outcomes of these patients were evaluated. Results A total of 44 patients who underwent robotic-assisted thoracic surgery after three doses of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy were included in this study. Of these, 36 of 44 (81.8%) patients had a major pathological response, and 26 (59.1%) had a pathological complete response based on pathological examination of surgical specimen. Eight patients (18.2%) suffered grade 3 treatment-related adverse events, including neutropenia (n = 4), increased aminotransferases (n = 3), anemia (n = 1), and cutaneous capillary endothelial proliferation (n = 1). Robotic-assisted thoracic surgery was performed subsequently, and R0 resection was achieved in all patients. Only two (4.5%) patients required conversion to thoracotomy. Surgical complications occurred in five (11.4%) patients, including air leak (n = 3), chylothorax (n = 2), and surgical site infection (n = 1). There was no re-surgery or postoperative mortality within 90 days. Conclusion Robotic-assisted thoracic surgery following neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy showed good feasibility and safety in stage III NSCLC. It was not associated with unexpected perioperative morbidity or mortality and may be a promising therapeutic option in stage III NSCLC. These results need further confirmation by more large-scale clinical trials.","authors":"Yang Gao, Juan Jiang, D. Xiao, Yan-Wu Zhou, Yufan Chen, Huaping Yang, Lijing Wang, J. Zeng, Baimei He, R.

Comparable, and in specific settings superior, perioperative outcomes compared to laparoscopic liver surgery have been reported. In its current form, the most commonly mentioned advantage of robotic surgery is improved dexterity. Important obstacles to its wider implementation in daily clinical practice are the associated costs, technical difficulties, and a scarce amount of evidence. Robotic liver surgery will likely continue to evolve in parallel with technological developments that enhance the robots\u2019 abilities. Abstract In parallel with the historical development of minimally invasive surgery, the laparoscopic and robotic approaches are now frequently utilized to perform major abdominal surgical procedures. Nevertheless, the role of the robotic approach in liver surgery is still controversial, and a standardized, safe technique has not been defined yet. This review aims to summarize the currently available evidence and prospects of robotic liver surgery. Minimally invasive liver surgery has been extensively associated with benefits, in terms of less blood loss, and lower complication rates, including liver-specific complications such as clinically relevant bile leakage and post hepatectomy liver failure, when compared to open liver surgery. Furthermore, comparable R0 resection rates to open liver surgery have been reported, thus, demonstrating the safety and oncological efficiency of the minimally invasive approach. However, whether robotic liver surgery has merits over laparoscopic liver surgery is still a matter of debate. In the current literature, robotic liver surgery has mainly been associated with non-inferior outcomes compared to laparoscopy, although it is suggested that the robotic approach has a shorter learning curve, lower conversion rates, and less intraoperative blood loss. Robotic surgical systems offer a more realistic image with integrated 3D systems. In addition, the improved dexterity offered by robotic surgical systems can lead to improved intra and postoperative outcomes. In the future, integrated and improved haptic feedback mechanisms, artificial intelligence, and the introduction of more liver-specific dissectors will likely be implemented, further enhancing the robots\u2019 abilities.","authors":"E.

This study compared clinical and economic outcomes for laparoscopic colectomy procedures with and without robotic assistance. Methods: Patients aged \u226518 years having primary inpatient laparoscopic colectomy procedures (cecectomy, right hemicolectomy, left hemicolectomy, and sigmoidectomy) identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition procedure codes performed between 2009 and the second quarter of 2011 from the Premier Hospital Database were studied. Patients were matched to a control cohort using propensity scores for disease, comorbidities, and hospital characteristics and were matched 1:1 for specific colectomy procedure. The outcomes of interest were hospital cost of laparoscopic robotic-assisted colectomy compared with traditional laparoscopic colectomy, surgery time, adverse events, and length of stay. Results: Of 25 758 laparoscopic colectomies identified, 98% were performed without robotic assistance and 2% were performed with robotic assistance. After matching, 1066 patients remained, 533 in each group. Lengths of stay were not significantly different between the matched cohorts, nor were rates of major, minor, and\/or surgical complications. Inpatient procedures with robotic assistance were significantly more costly than those without robotic assistance ($17 445 vs $15 448, P = .001). Operative times were significantly longer for robotic-assisted procedures (4.37 hours vs 3.34 hours, P < .001). Conclusion: Segmental colectomies can be performed safely by either laparoscopic or robotic-assisted methods. Increased per-case hospital costs for robotic-assisted procedures and prolonged operative times suggest that further investigation is warranted when considering robotic technology for routine laparoscopic colectomies.","authors":"B.

The CorPath system further enhances the potential and enables surgeons to perform robotic-assisted endovascular procedures in interventional cardiology, peripheral vascular surgery, and neurovascular surgery. With the introduction of this technique, the operator can perform multiple steps of endovascular interventions outside of the radiation field with high precision movements even from long-geographical distances. Areas covered The first and second-generation CorPath systems are currently the only commercially available robotic devices for endovascular surgery. This review article discusses the clinical experiences and outcomes with the robot, the advanced navigational features, and the results with recent hardware and software modifications, which enables the use of the system for neurovascular interventions, and long-distance interventional procedures. Expert opinion A high procedural success was achieved with the CorPath robotic systems in coronary and peripheral interventions, and the device seems promising in neurovascular procedures. More experience is needed with robotic neurovascular interventions and with complex peripheral arterial cases. In the future, long-distance endovascular surgery can potentially transform the management and treatment of acute myocardial infarction and stroke, with making endovascular care more accessible for patients in remote areas.","authors":"Peter T Legeza, G.

Our population of interest was any patient undergoing robotic urologic surgery. Our outcomes of interest were (1) clinical effectiveness, (2) safety parameters, and (3) health system outcomes. Results: Of 83 records identified and screened at title\/abstract level, 17 were examined for full-text, of which 10 studies enrolling a total of 1765 patients (cohorts ranging in size from 11 to 642 patients) were ultimately used for review. AirSeal resulted in improved respiratory parameters, specifically lower inspiratory plateau pressure, lower minute volume, lower CO2 elimination rate, low end-tidal CO2, and higher static compliance. Two studies described decreased complication rates with low pneumoperitoneum. There were mixed results regarding AirSeal effect on operative time. Conclusion: Valveless trocar technology using the AirSeal system is a valuable adjunct to current robotic urologic surgery. The established benefits include improved cardiopulmonary parameters, particularly within the steep trendelenburg position that is common in pelvic surgery. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the effects on safety and hospital system-wide outcomes.","authors":"S. Razdan, Burak Ucpinar, K. Okhawere, K.

Therefore, we evaluated the short-term outcomes of robotic surgery for rectal cancer. Materials and Methods Thirty-three patients with cT3N0-2 rectal cancer after preoperative CRT who underwent robotic low anterior resection (R-LAR) between March 2010 and January 2012 were matched with 66 patients undergoing laparoscopic low anterior resection (L-LAR). Perioperative clinical outcomes and pathological data were compared between the two groups. Results Patient characteristics did not differ significantly different between groups. The mean operation time was 441 minutes (R-LAR) versus 277 minutes (L-LAR, p < 0.001). The open conversion rate was 6.1% in the R-LAR group and 0% in the L-LAR group (p=0.11). There were no significant differences in the time to flatus passage, length of hospital stay, and postoperative morbidity. In pathological review, the mean number of harvested lymph nodes was 22.3 in R-LAR and 21.6 in L-LAR (p=0.82). Involvement of circumferential resection margin was positive in 16.1% and 6.7%, respectively (p=0.42). Total mesorectal excision (TME) quality was complete in 97.0% in R-LAR and 91.0% in L-LAR (p=0.41). Conclusion In our study, short-term outcomes of robotic surgery for rectal cancer after CRT were similar to those of laparoscopic surgery in respect to bowel function recovery, morbidity, and TME quality. Well-designed clinical trials are needed to evaluate the functional results and long-term outcomes of robotic surgery for rectal cancer.","authors":"Yong Sok Kim, M. Kim, S. Park, D. Sohn, D. Kim, H.

The aim of this retrospective study was to compare the perioperative and long-term outcomes of patients who underwent lobectomy by these two surgical approaches.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed a retrospective review of the prospectively collected database of our hospital to identify patients with clinical stage IIB-IIIA NSCLC who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic or robotic lobectomy. Perioperative outcomes, recurrence, and overall survival (OS) were compared.\n\n\nResults\nFrom January 2014 to January 2017, there were at total of 121 patients, including 36 robotic lobectomy patients and 85 VATS lobectomy patients. One patient (2.8%) in the RATS group and 5 patients (5.9%) in the VATS group were converted to thoracotomy (P=0.79). No perioperative death was observed in both groups. The postoperative morbidity was similar between the two groups (13.9% for RATS vs. 15.3% for VATS; P=0.84). Robotic lobectomy was associated with a shorter length of postoperative hospital stay (4 vs. 5 d, P<0.01) and more counts of lymph nodes harvested (13 vs. 10, P<0.01). The median disease-free survival (DFS) for the RATS and VATS groups were 31.1 and 33.8 months, respectively. The corresponding 3-year DFS was 40.3% in the RATS group and 47.6% in the VATS group (P=0.74).

The aim of this study was to compare the perioperative outcomes of minimally invasive (laparoscopic and robotic) pancreatic surgery with open pancreatic surgery using data obtained from RCTs. Methods A literature search was done using Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Web of Science; all available RCTs comparing minimally invasive pancreatic surgery and open pancreatic surgery in adults requiring elective distal pancreatectomy or partial pancreatoduodenectomy were included. Outcomes were mortality rate, general and pancreatic surgery specific morbidity rate, and length of hospital stay. Results Six RCTs with 984 patients were included; 99.0 per cent (486) of minimally invasive procedures were performed laparoscopically and 1.0 per cent (five) robotically. In minimally invasive pancreatic surgery, length of hospital stay (\u22121.3 days, \u22122 to \u22120.5, P = 0.001) and intraoperative blood loss (\u2212137\u2005ml, \u2212182 to \u221292, P < 0.001) were reduced. In the subgroup analysis, reduction in length of hospital stay was only present for minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy (\u22122 days, \u22122.3 to \u22121.7, P < 0.001). A minimally invasive approach showed reductions in surgical site infections (OR 0.4, 0.1 to 0.96, P = 0.040) and intraoperative blood loss (\u2212131\u2005ml, \u2212173 to \u221289, P < 0.001) with a 75\u2005min longer duration of surgery (42 to 108\u2005min, P < 0.001) only in partial pancreatoduodenectomy. No significant differences were found with regards to mortality rate and postoperative complications. Conclusion This meta-analysis presents level 1 evidence of reduced length of hospital stay and intraoperative blood loss in minimally invasive pancreatic surgery compared with open pancreatic surgery. Morbidity rate and mortality rate were comparable, but longer duration of surgery in minimally invasive partial pancreatoduodenectomy hints that this technique in partial pancreatoduodenectomy is technically more challenging than in distal pancreatectomy.","authors":"M.

The functional outcome reporting tools most commonly included: the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Mean scores and changes in mean scores from baseline were analysed using RevMan version 5.3.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTen studies were included reporting on 1286 patients. Some 672 patients underwent LRCS, of whom 380 (56.5 per cent) were men and 116 (17.3 per cent) were women (gender not specified in 176 patients, 26.2 per cent).

Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and propensity score matching were performed in patients with known human papillomavirus status to adjust for patient- and disease-related covariates. Survival after robotic and nonrobotic surgery was also compared in 3 unrelated cancers: prostate, endometrial, and cervical cancer. Statistical analysis was performed from April 10, 2019, to May 21, 2020.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nOverall survival.\n\n\nResults\nOf 9745 patients (7652 men [78.5%]; mean [SD] age, 58.8 [9.6] years) who met inclusion criteria, 2694 (27.6%) underwent transoral robotic surgery. There was a significant increase in the use of robotic surgery from 18.3% (240 of 1309) to 35.5% (654 of 1841) of all surgical procedures for T1 and T2 oropharyngeal cancers from 2010 to 2015 (P\u2009=\u2009.003). Robotic surgery was associated with lower rates of positive surgical margins (12.5% [218 of 1746] vs 20.3% [471 of 2325]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and lower use of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (28.6% [500 of 1746] vs 35.7% [831 of 2325]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Among 4071 patients with known human papillomavirus status, robotic surgery was associated with improved overall survival compared with nonrobotic surgery in multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95 CI, 0.61-0.90; P\u2009=\u2009.002).

Robotic surgery has the potential to overcome some limitations of laparoscopic surgery, especially in the narrow pelvis, providing a three-dimensional view, articulated instruments, and a stable camera platform. Although meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials have failed to demonstrate the superiority of robotic surgery over laparoscopic surgery with respect to the short-term clinical outcomes, the published findings suggest that robotic surgery may be potentially beneficial for patients who are obese, male, or patients undergoing sphincter-preserving surgery for rectal cancer. The safety and feasibility of robotic surgery for lateral lymph node dissection, the standard procedure for locally advanced lower rectal cancer in Japan, have been demonstrated in some retrospective studies. However, additional prospective, randomized trials are required to determine the actual benefits of robotic surgery to ameliorate the urogenital and oncological outcomes. The cost of this approach is a long-standing principal concern. A literature search showed that the cost of robotic surgery for rectal cancer was 1.3-2.5 times higher per patient than that for the laparoscopic approach.

A Network Meta-analysis.","abstract":"BACKGROUND\nSeveral kinds of cutting guides, including patient-specific instrumentation, navigation, standard cutting guides, accelerometer-based navigation, and robotic guidance, are available to restore a planned alignment during TKA. No previous study has simultaneously compared all of these devices; a network meta-analysis is an especially appealing method because it allows comparisons across approaches that were not compared head-to-head in individual randomized controlled trials.\n\n\nQUESTIONS\/PURPOSES\nWe performed a network meta-analysis to determine whether novel approaches to achieving implant alignment, such as patient-specific instrumentation, navigation, accelerometer-based navigation, and robotic guidance, provide any advantage over standard cutting guides in terms of: (1) hip-knee-ankle (HKA) alignment outliers greater than \u00b1 3\u00b0, (2) outcome scores (1989 - Knee Society Score and WOMAC score) measured 6 months after surgery, or (3) femoral and tibial implant malalignment (greater than \u00b1 3\u00b0), taken separately, in the frontal and sagittal plane, as well as other secondary outcomes including validated outcome scores 1 and 2 years after surgery.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn our network meta-analysis, we included randomized controlled trials comparing the different cutting guides by using at least one of the previously specified criteria, without limitation on language or date of publication. We searched electronic databases, major orthopaedic journals, proceedings of major orthopaedic meetings, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform until October 1, 2018. This led to the inclusion of 90 randomized controlled trials involving 9389 patients (mean age 68.8 years) with 10,336 TKAs. Two reviewers independently selected trials and extracted data. The primary outcomes were the proportion patients with malalignment of the HKA angle (defined as HKA > 3\u00b0 from neutral) and the Knee Society Score and WOMAC scores at 6 months postoperatively. We combined direct and indirect comparisons using a Bayesian network meta-analysis framework to assess and compare the effect of different cutting guides on outcomes. Bayesian estimates are based on the posterior distribution of an endpoint and are called credible intervals. Usually the 95% credible interval, corresponding to a posterior probability of 0.95 that the endpoint lies in the interval, is computed. Unlike the frequentist approach, the Bayesian approach does not allow the calculation of the p value.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe proportion of HKA outliers was lower with navigation than with patient-specific instrumentation (risk ratio 0.46 [95% credible interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.63]) and standard cutting guides (risk ratio 0.45 [95% CI 0.37 to 0.53]); however, this corresponded to an actual difference of only 12% of patients for navigation versus 21% of patients for patient-specific instrumentation, and 12% of patients for navigation versus 25% for standard cutting guides. We found no differences for other comparisons between different cutting guides, including robotics and the accelerometer. We found no differences in the Knee Society Score or WOMAC score between the different cutting guides at 6 months. Regarding secondary outcomes, navigation reduced the risk of frontal and sagittal malalignments for femoral and tibial components compared with the standard cutting guides, but none of the other cutting guides showed superiority for the other secondary outcomes.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNavigation resulted in approximately 10% fewer patients having HKA outliers of more than 3\u00b0, without any corresponding improvement in validated outcomes scores. It is unknown whether this incremental reduction in the proportion of patients who have alignment outside a window that itself has been called into question will justify the increased costs and surgical time associated with the approach. We believe that until or unless these new approaches either (1) convincingly demonstrate superior survivorship, or (2) convincingly demonstrate superior outcomes, surgeons and hospitals should not use these approaches since they add cost, have a learning curve (during which some patients may be harmed), and have the risks associated with uncertainty of novel surgical approaches.\n\n\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE\nLevel I, therapeutic study.","authors":"P.

Many surgeons have embraced the robotic platform due to its technological advances over traditional laparoscopy including high\u2010definition 3D optics, wristed instrumentation, camera stability and improved ergonomics. While robotic surgery continues as a mainstay in the management of gynecologic cancers, it remains controversial in regards to its cost effectiveness and more recently, its long\u2010term impact on clinical and oncologic outcomes. A strong component of the justification of this surgical platform is based on extrapolated data from traditional laparoscopy despite limited prospective randomized trials for robotic\u2010assisted surgery.

From December 2014 to November 2019, 683 consecutive patients with AGC underwent mini-invasive assisted distal gastrectomy. Propensity-score matching (PSM) analysis was conducted to reduce patient selection bias. Short-term outcomes were compared between the two groups. The clinical features were well matched in the PSM cohort. Compared with the LADG group, the RADG group was associated with less operative blood loss, a lower rate of postoperative blood transfusion, less volume of abdominal drainage, less time to remove abdominal drainage tube, retrieved more lymph node, and lower rates of surgical complications and pancreatic fistula (P <0.05). However, the time to recovery bowel function, the length of postoperative stay, the rates of other subgroups of complications and unplanned readmission were similar between the two groups (P > 0.05).

The oncological outcomes of the whole series of patients were analysed. Furthermore, because consistent data are not yet available in the literature, the main focus was the analysis of the neurological results of the patients affected by MG and thymoma.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe clinical outcomes of 53 patients with a diagnosis of thymoma who underwent robotic thymectomy between January 2014 and December 2019 in our institution were collected and evaluated; 34 of these patients had a concomitant diagnosis of MG. The neurological status of the patients was determined from a clinical evaluation according to the Osserman classification and on pre- and post-surgery Myasthenia Gravis Composite scores, whereas neurological clinical outcomes were assessed using the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America Post-Intervention Score. Reduction of steroid therapy was also considered. The recurrence rate, adjuvant radiotherapy and overall survival of the patients with a thymoma were evaluated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNeurological outcomes: improvement of the clinical conditions was obtained in 26 patients (76.5%) following the operation: complete stable remission was observed in 5 patients (14.7%), pharmacological remission in 10 (29.4%) and minimal manifestation in 11 (32.3%). Four patients (11.8%) exhibited no substantial change from the pretreatment clinical manifestations or reduction in MG medication and 4 (11.8%) patients experienced worsening of clinical conditions. In 21 patients (61.7%) a reduction of the dosage of steroid therapy was obtained. Oncological outcomes: at an average follow-up of 36\u2009months, the overall survival was 96%, 4 patients (7.5%) had pleural relapses and 12 patients (22.6%) underwent postoperative radiotherapy, according to their stage. In accordance with Masaoka staging, 34% were in stage I, 56.6% in stage II and 9.4% in stage III.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results suggest that robotic surgical treatment of patients with thymoma and concomitant MG is effective in improving the neurological outcomes. Moreover, the oncological results obtained in this series confirm the efficacy of robotic surgery for the treatment of thymic malignancies, with results in line with those of open surgery. However, due to the indolent growth of thymomas, further observations with longer follow-up are necessary.","authors":"G. Romano, C. Zirafa, Ilaria Ceccarelli, M. Guida, F. Davini, M. Maestri, R.

These demonstrations are meant to serve as an educational medium for teaching techniques, promote discussion, improve interventions and outcomes. Despite the valuable educational benefits, many authors still question the ethics of this approach. We present our 8-year experience in live surgery, discuss the ethical issues, and provide recommendations. Materials and Methods We reviewed records of patients who underwent live robotic surgery during broadcasting events. Procedures performed were robot-assisted laparoscopic pyeloplasty (RAL-P), ureteral reimplantation (RALUR), and hemi-nephrectomy (RAL-HN). Peri- and post-operative outcomes were compared to our previously published case series. Results From October 2011 to May 2019, the senior author (MSG) performed all live surgery demonstrations on 22 patients: 9 RAL-P, 9 RALUR, and 4 RAL-HN. Live RAL-Ps had a 100% success rate and lower 30-day Clavien-Dindo grade (CDG) III complications when compared to our previous case series (11.1% vs. 21.2%). RALURs performed during live demonstrations had a higher success rate than our previously published cohort (100% vs. 82%). RAL-HN operative time and length of stay were comparable to our non-live control group. Conclusions Live surgery is a valuable didactic tool, but even experienced surgeons may be adversely affected by inappropriate case selection, technical difficulty, and anxiety associated with particular settings, such as operating at different institutions or working with unfamiliar surgical teams. We suggest consultation of an ethics review board and formulation of standard guidelines for patient selection, surgical equipment, and operative team.","authors":"C. Andolfi, M.

Five major reconstruction techniques were utilized: end-to-end (anastomosing the bladder to the transected ureter) and side-to-side (anastomosing the bladder to an anterior ureterotomy proximal to the stricture without ureteral transection) ureteral reimplantation, buccal or appendiceal mucosa graft ureteroplasty, appendiceal bypass graft, and ileal ureter interposition. When necessary, adjunctive procedures were performed for mobility (i.e. psoas hitch) and improved vascularity (i.e. omental wrap). Outcomes of surgery were determined by absence of flank pain (clinical success) and absence of obstruction on imaging (radiological success).\n\n\nRESULTS\nTotal of 32 patients with 35 ureteral units underwent RUR with median stricture length of 2.5cm (IQR 2-5.5). End-to-end and side-to-side reimplantation were performed in 21 (60.0%) and 8 (22.9%) of RUR's, respectively; while 4 (11.4%) underwent an appendiceal procedure. One patient (2.9%) required a buccal mucosa graft ureteroplasty, while another needed an ileal ureter interposition. The median operative time was 215 minutes (IQR 177-281), estimated blood loss was 100mL (IQR 50-150), and length of stay was 2 days (IQR 1-3). One patient required repair of a small bowel leak. Another patient died from a major cardiac event and was excluded from follow up calculations. At a median follow up of 13 months (IQR 9-22), 30 ureteral units (88.2%) were clinically and radiologically successful.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nRUR can be performed in patients with RIUS with excellent outcomes. Surgeons must be prepared to perform adjunctive procedures for mobility and improved vascularity due to poor tissue quality. Caution must be taken in such reconstructive surgeries, especially with repeat procedures due to the risk of necrosis and failure.","authors":"A. Asghar, Z. Lee, Randall A. Lee, J.

This study was designed to report our experience with the pediatric robotic mini-fellowship (PRM) and to evaluate the impact this course had on the participants' practice. Methods: The mini-fellowship training at our institution is provided in two modules, including upper and lower urinary tract surgery, over a 5-day period. The one to one teacher-to-attendee experience included tutorial sessions, hands-on inanimate, and animate skills training, clinical case observations and video discussions. Participants were asked to complete a detailed questionnaire on their practice patterns before and after the PRM. Results: Between 2012 and 2018, a total of 29 national and international pediatric surgeons and urologists underwent robotic renal and bladder surgery training. Twenty-six fellows (90%) completed the surveys, all of which were included for analysis. The median age at the time of fellowship was 43 years (32\u201363), and participants had practiced urology for a median of 76 months (3\u2013372). All of them had a laparoscopic background, with a median experience of 120 months (12\u2013372), and an average of 454 (\u00b1 703) laparoscopic procedures performed, including the years of training. The most common primary goals of participants were to understand the concept of robotic surgery and its applications (38.5%), and to practice in the wet lab to shorten their learning curve (38.5%). After PRM completion, 24 graduates (92%) felt likely to incorporate robotic surgery into their practice, of which 15 (58%) actually started a robotic program at their home institution. At 24 months after PRM completion, the overall number of surgeries performed with a robotic approach (RA) by these 15 participants was 478 with an average of 32 (\u00b1 44) procedures per fellow, of which 109 (23%) were extirpative (nephrectomy, partial nephrectomy, etc.), and 369 (77%) reconstructive procedures (pyeloplasty, ureteral reimplantation, etc.). Before PRM, the same 15 participants performed 844 procedures with a laparoscopic approach (LA), of which 527 (62.4%) were extirpative, and 317 (37.6%) were reconstructive surgeries. These data mark a significant switch in indications for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in pediatric urology. The rise in the number of reconstructive procedures (37.6% LA vs. 77% RA) has shown that robotic surgery has undoubtedly facilitated the performance of more challenging procedures in a minimally invasive fashion. Conclusion: The success of a mini-fellowship program relies on the commitment of expert faculty to serve as tutorial instructors and proctors. In addition, a completely outfitted robotic laboratory with access to dry and wet lab is indispensable. A 5-day intensive PRM appears to enable postgraduate surgeons to successfully incorporate the robotic platform into their practice and to advance the complexity of minimally invasive procedures, allowing for more challenging surgeries, such as reconstructive urology.","authors":"C.

Most existing methods to estimate technical skills remain subjective and resource intensive. Robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) provides a unique opportunity to develop objective metrics using key elements of intraoperative surgeon behavior which can be captured unobtrusively, such as instrument positions and button presses. Recent studies have shown that objective metrics based on these data (referred to as objective performance indicators [OPIs]) correlate to select clinical outcomes during robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy. However, the current OPIs remain difficult to interpret directly and, therefore, to use within structured feedback to improve surgical efficiencies. Methods: We analyzed kinematic and event data from da Vinci surgical systems (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) to calculate values that can summarize the use of robotic instruments, referred to as OPIs. These indicators were mapped to broader technical skill categories of established training protocols. A data-driven approach was then applied to further sub-select OPIs that distinguish skill for each technical skill category within each training task. This subset of OPIs was used to build a set of logistic regression classifiers that predict the probability of expertise in that skill to identify targeted improvement and practice. The final, proposed feedback using OPIs was based on the coefficients of the logistic regression model to highlight specific actions that can be taken to improve. Results: We determine that for the majority of skills, only a small subset of OPIs (2\u201310) are required to achieve the highest model accuracies (80\u201395%) for estimating technical skills within clinical-like tasks on a porcine model. The majority of the skill models have similar accuracy as models predicting overall expertise for a task (80\u201398%). Skill models can divide a prediction into interpretable categories for simpler, targeted feedback. Conclusion: We define and validate a methodology to create interpretable metrics for key technical skills during clinical-like tasks when performing RAS. Using this framework for evaluating technical skills, we believe that surgical trainees can better understand both what can be improved and how to improve.","authors":"Kristen C.

Current literature is undecided on the advantages of robotic rectal resection and little is known on its learning curve. This study aimed to compare the outcomes of the first 100 robotic rectal resections to the laparoscopic approach in a teaching hospital experienced in laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted of a prospective cohort of all consecutive rectal resections between January 2012 and September 2019 at a single center. All laparoscopic cases were compared to the robotic approach. Outcomes included operative time, morbidity, anastomotic leakage, and hospital stay. Results Out of the 326 consecutive resections, 100 were performed robotically and 220 laparoscopically, the remaining 6 open cases were excluded. Median operative time was lower for robotic cases (147 (121\u2013167) versus 162 (120\u2013218) minutes P \u2009=\u20090.024). Overall morbidity was lower in robotic cases (25% versus 50%, P \u2009<\u20090.001), while major morbidity was similar. Anastomotic leakage was observed in 11% (8\/70) of robotic and 15% (18\/120) of laparoscopic anastomoses, despite more anastomoses in the robotic group (70%, 70\/100 versus 55%, 120\/220, P \u2009=\u20090.001). Median length of stay was 4 (4\u20137) days after a robotic and 6 (5\u20139) days after a laparoscopic procedure. Discussion Implementation of a robotic rectal resection program in an experienced laparoscopic surgery center was associated with reduced operative time, length of stay, and fewer complications despite a learning curve.","authors":"P.

Data Sources and Study Selection: A systematic search (Ovid MEDLINE databases) was conducted (May 2017) to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing the efficacy of the da Vinci robot on clinical outcomes. Financial COI data for authors (per study) were determined using open payments database. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes assessed were receipt of financial COI payments and overall conclusion reported between robotic versus comparative approach. Quality\/risk of bias was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS)\/Cochrane risk of bias tool. Disclosure discrepancies were also analyzed. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Study characteristics, surgical subspecialty, methodological assessment, reporting of disclosure statements, and study findings dual abstracted. The association of the amount of financial support received as a predictor of reporting positive findings associated robotic surgery was assessed at various cut-offs of dollar amount received by receiver operating curve (ROC). Results: Thirty-three studies were included, 9 RCTs and 24 observational studies. There was a median, 111 patients (range 10 to 6420) across studies. A little more than half (17\/33) had a conclusion statement reporting positive results in support of robotic surgery, with 48% (16\/33) reporting results not in favor [equivocal: 12\/33 (36%), negative: 4\/33 (12%)]. Nearly all (91%) studies had authors who received financial COI payments, with a median of $3364.46 per study (range $9 to $1,775,378.03). ROC curve demonstrated that studies receiving greater than $9557.31 (cutpoint) were more likely to report positive robotic surgery results (sensitivity: 0.65, specificity: 0.81, area under the curve: 0.73). Studies with financial COI payment greater than this amount were more likely to report beneficial outcomes with robotic surgery [(78.57% vs 31.58%, P = 0.013) with an odds ratio of 2.07 (confidence interval: 0.47\u20133.67; P = 0.011)].

Methods Clinical data on consecutive patients who underwent robotic-assisted total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer by a single surgeon between January 2015 and December 2018 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University were retrospectively collected. The cumulative sum (CUSUM) and risk-adjusted cumulative sum (RA-CUSUM) were used to visualize the learning curve of operation time and postoperative complications (CD \u2265 grade II). Comparisons of clinical outcomes at different learning phases analyzed by RA-CUSUM were performed after propensity score matching. Results A total of 389 consecutive patients were included in the analysis. The numbers of patients needed to overcome the learning curves of operation time and postoperative complications of robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer were 34 and 36, respectively. The learning process was divided into two phases based on RA-CUSUM: the learning phase (1st-36th cases) and the mastery phase (37th-389th cases). Before matching, the mastery phase had more patients with older age, lower tumor location, and neoadjuvant therapy. After matching, the two phases exhibited similar characteristics. The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative hospital stay, and postoperative complications in the mastery phase were reduced compared with the learning phase, with a median follow-up of 35 months, and the long-term oncologic outcomes were not significantly different between the two phases. Conclusions An experienced laparoscopic surgeon initially implements robotic-assisted total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer, surgical outcomes improved after 36 cases, and the learning curve seemingly did not have an obvious impact on long-term oncologic outcomes.","authors":"Bo Tang, Tao Li, G.

Robotic rectal surgery has been performed for three decades and its application is gradually expanding along with technology development. It has several technical advantages which include magnified three-dimensional vision, better ergonomics, multiple articulated robotic instruments, and the opportunity to perform remote surgery. The technical benefits of robotic system can help to manipulate more meticulously during technical challenging procedures including total mesorectal excision in narrow pelvis, lateral pelvic node dissection, and intersphincteric resection. It is also reported that robotic rectal surgery have been shown more favorable postoperative functional outcomes. Despite its technical benefits, a majority of studies have been reported that there is rarely clinical or oncologic superiority of robotic surgery for rectal cancer compared to conventional laparoscopic surgery. In addition, robotic rectal surgery showed significantly higher costs than the standard method. Hence, the cost-effectiveness of robotic rectal surgery is still questionable. In order for robotic rectal surgery to further develop in the field of minimally invasive surgery, there should be an obvious cost-effective advantages over laparoscopic surgery, and it is crucial that large-scale prospective randomized trials are required. Positive competition of industries in correlation with technological development may gradually reduce the price of the robotic system, and it will be helpful to increase the cost-effectiveness of robotic rectal surgery.","authors":"Y.

Laparoscopic right hemicolectomy (LRH) is considered technically challenging. Robotic surgery has been introduced to overcome this technical limitation, but it is related to high costs. To maximize the benefits of such surgery, only selected patients are candidates for this technique. In addition, due to progressive aging of the population, an increasing number of minimally invasive procedures are performed on elderly patients with severe comorbidities, who are usually more prone to post-operative complications. AIM To investigate the outcomes of RRH vs LRH with regard to age and comorbidities. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 123 minimally invasive procedures (68 LRHs vs 55 RRHs) for right colon cancer or endoscopically unresectable adenoma performed in our Center from January 2014 until September 2019. The surgical procedures were performed according to standardized techniques. The primary clinical outcome of the study was the length of hospital stay (LOS) measured in days. Secondary outcomes were time to first flatus (TFF) and time to first stool evacuation. The robotic technique was considered the exposure and the laparoscopic technique was considered the control. Routine demographic variables were obtained, including age at time of surgery and gender. Body mass index and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status were registered. The age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index (ACCI) was calculated; the tumor-node-metastasis system, intra-operative variables and post-operative complications were recorded. Post-operative follow-up was 180 d. RESULTS LOS, TFF, and time to first stool were significantly shorter in the robotic group: Median 6 [interquartile range (IQR) 5-8] vs 7 (IQR 6-10.5) d, P = 0.028; median 2 (IQR 1-3) vs 3 (IQR 2-4) d, P < 0.001; median 4 (IQR 3-5) vs 5 (IQR 4-6.5) d, P = 0.005, respectively. Following multivariable analysis, the robotic technique was confirmed to be predictive of significantly shorter hospitalization and faster restoration of bowel function; in addition the dichotomous variables of age over 75 years and ACCI more than 7 were significant predictors of hospital stay. No outcomes were significantly associated with Clavien-Dindo grading. Sub-group analysis demonstrated that patients aged over 75 years had a longer LOS (median 6 -IQR 5-8- vs 7 -IQR 6-12- d, P = 0.013) and later TFF (median 2 -IQR 1-3- vs 3 -IQR 2-4- d, P = 0.008), while patients with ACCI more than 7 were only associated with a prolonged hospital stay (median 7 -IQR 5-8- vs 7 -IQR 6-14.5- d, P = 0.036). CONCLUSION RRH is related to shorter LOS when compared with the laparoscopic approach, but older age and several comorbidities tend to reduce its benefits.","authors":"F. Tagliabue, M. Burati, M.

However, most of these studies enroll patients at a relatively early stage and have small sample sizes. In fact, studies only on patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) and with relatively large sample sizes are lacking. AIM To investigate whether the short-term outcomes differed between robotic-assisted proctectomy (RAP) and laparoscopic-assisted proctectomy (LAP) for LARC. METHODS The clinicopathological data of patients with LARC who underwent robotic- or laparoscopic-assisted radical surgery between January 2015 and October 2019 were collected retrospectively. To reduce patient selection bias, we used the clinical baseline characteristics of the two groups of patients as covariates for propensity-score matching (PSM) analysis. Short-term outcomes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS The clinical features were well matched in the PSM cohort. Compared with the LAP group, the RAP group had less intraoperative blood loss, lower volume of pelvic cavity drainage, less time to remove the pelvic drainage tube and urinary catheter, longer distal resection margin and lower rates of conversion (P < 0.05). However, the time to recover bowel function, the harvested lymph nodes, the postoperative length of hospital stay, and the rate of unplanned readmission within 30 days postoperatively showed no difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). The rates of total complications and all individual complications were similar between the RAP and LAP groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION This retrospective study indicated that RAP is a safe and feasible method for LARC with better short-term outcomes than LAP, but we have to admit that the clinically significant of part of indicators are relatively small in the practical situation.","authors":"S.

LPS and robotic pancreatic surgery (RPS) have been proven to result in superior short-term perioperative outcomes and equivalent long-term oncological outcomes compared to the conventional open approach, with the caveat that they are performed by expert surgeons who have been trained to perform such procedures. The primary challenge faced by most pancreatic surgeons is the steep learning curve associated with these complex procedures and the need to undergo surgical training, especially with regards to laparoscopic and robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy.

Materials and Methods We retrospectively reviewed our Collaborative of Reconstructive Robotic Ureteral Surgery (CORRUS) database to identify all patients who underwent robotic ureteral reconstruction for long-segment (\u22654 centimeters) proximal ureteral strictures between August 2012 and June 2019. The primary surgeon determined the specific technique to reconstruct the ureter at time of surgery based on the patient's clinical history and intraoperative findings. Our primary outcome was surgical success, which we defined as the absence of ureteral obstruction on radiographic imaging and absence of obstructive flank pain. Results Of 20 total patients, 4 (20.0%) underwent robotic ureteroureterostomy (RUU) with downward nephropexy (DN), 2 (10.0%) underwent robotic ureterocalycostomy (RUC) with DN, and 14 (70.0%) underwent robotic ureteroplasty with buccal mucosa graft (RU-BMG). Median stricture length was 4 centimeters (interquartile range [IQR], 4\u20134; maximum, 5), 6 centimeters (IQR, 5\u20137; maximum, 8), and 5 centimeters (IQR, 4\u20135; maximum, 8) for patients undergoing RUU with DN, RUC with DN, and RU-BMG, respectively. At a median follow-up of 24 (IQR, 14\u201351) months, 17\/20 (85.0%) cases were surgically successful. Two of four patients (50.0%) who underwent RUU with DN developed stricture recurrences within 3 months. Conclusions Long-segment proximal ureteral strictures may be safely and effectively managed with RUC with DN and RU-BMG. Although RUU with DN can be utilized, this technique may be associated with a higher failure rate.","authors":"Matthew S. Lee, Z. Lee, Helaine Koster, M. Jun, A. Asghar, R. Lee, D.

Previous suture breakage warning systems have largely depended on visual and\/or auditory feedback modalities, which have been shown to increase cognitive load and reduce operator performance. This work catalogues a new sensing technology and haptic feedback system (HFS) that can reduce instances of suture failure without negatively impacting performance outcomes including knot quality. Suture breakage is common in knot-tying as the pulling motion introduces prominent shear forces. A shear sensor mountable on the da Vinci robotic surgical system's Cadiere grasper detects forces that correlate to the suture's internal tension. HFS then provides vibration feedback to the operator as forces near a particular material's failure load. To validate the system, subjects tightened a total of four knots, two with the Haptic Feedback System (HFS) and two without feedback. The number of suture breakages were recorded and knot fidelity was evaluated by measuring knot slippage. Results showed that instances of suture failure were significantly reduced when HFS was enabled (p = 0.0078). Notably, knots tied with HFS also showed improved quality compared to those tied without feedback (p = 0.010). The results highlight the value of HFS in improving robotic procedure outcomes by reducing instances of suture failures, producing better knots, and reducing the need for corrective measures.","authors":"Ahmad Abiri, Syed J.

The minimum follow-up was 90 days.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 722 adult patients were included (117 Renaissance, 477 X, 128 Stealth). Most patient and operative factors (e.g., sex, tobacco status, total instrumented levels, and pelvic fixation,) were similar across the years. Mean \u00b1 standard deviation Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was 1.5\u00b11.5.

This report is another important contribution to the field of less-invasive mitral valve surgery and adds to the understanding of different technologic platforms available for this procedure. The outcomes presented are impressive. There was no patient mortality. The last 25 patients were extubated in the operating room. Median hospital stay was 3 days. Only 15% of patients had any blood products. At 1 month after surgery, 82 patients had no mitral regurgitation (MR) or trivial MR, and 18 had mild MR. These outcomes are a testament to the expertise and commitment of the Mayo Clinic team of clinicians. Prior publications2-9 have shown similar results, indicating that the technique of robotic mitral valve repair is reproducible. \n \nRobot-assisted mitral valve surgery is but one effort to improve mitral valve function while reducing perioperative morbidity and mortality compared with traditional open chest, open heart surgery. Competing with robotic-assisted mitral valve repair is the cutting edge technology of the mitral clip percutaneous procedure.10 The mitral clip is inserted through a delivery catheter from the right femoral vein and, via a transeptal approach, is positioned into the mitral valve under echocardiographic and fluoroscopic control. The clip grasps the free edge of the anterior and posterior leaflet at the site of regurgitation, creating a double-orifice mitral valve and decreasing significantly the amount of regurgitation. The percutaneous clip will most likely be combined with a percutaneous mitral annular band system that may be introduced into the clinical arena in the near future. \n \nThese developments need to be put in perspective with what is happening in Europe, where percutaneous valve therapies have a much larger penetration than in the United States and where robotic technology in cardiac surgery is far behind that of the United States as far as acceptance by surgeons. \n \nIn Europe, alternative, less-invasive procedures include mitral valve repair under direct vision through a right minithoracotomy11-14 and the total endoscopic approach through a 3- to 4-cm incision as performed by Casselman et al.15,16 These approaches have also been performed in the United States, particularly by New York University surgeons.16,17 These techniques compete with the robotic approach, and currently, there is no indication that the robotic technique is any better or worse than the others or that it is any more reproducible. Further study is required to determine which surgical approach is eventually superior and whether superiority of one technique over another is limited to specific subsets of patients. \n \nSee also page 838 \n \nHaving personally seen surgical pioneers Dr Hugo Vanermen of Aalst, Belgium, and Dr Friedrich Mohr of Leipzig, Germany, perform a mitral valve repair via the total endoscopic approach or under direct visualization through a right minithoracotomy incision, respectively, I must say that both techniques appear to be equivalent and probably equally acceptable to patients. \n \nA consensus statement of the International Society of Minimally Invasive Cardiac Surgery (ISMICS) 201018 on minimally invasive vs open mitral valve surgery concluded, on the basis of review of retrospective studies, that, in patients with mitral valve disease, minimally invasive surgery either robotically or through a right minithoracotomy may be an alternative to conventional mitral valve surgery, given the similar short- and long-term mortality and also the reduced sternum complications, transfusion requirements, and hospital stay. However, the risk of stroke was higher with minimally invasive surgery than with conventional approaches (2.1% vs 1.2%) as was the risk of aortic dissection, phrenic nerve palsy, and groin complications; additionally, cross clamp times and cardiopulmonary bypass time were increased. These data and conclusions were obviously based on observation studies and not on randomized trials. \n \nOur experience with the DaVinci robotic system (ie, the system also used by Suri et al) in the performance of minimally invasive mitral valve surgery continues to be positive and satisfying, encompassing more than 200 patients with 1 death and 2 permanent strokes. Yes, there is room for improvement in the robotic arena. There is still only one company in the world that makes the robotic system (Intuitive Surgical, Inc, Sunnyvale, CA) and thus no competition in the field. The price for the robotic system is arbitrarily too high and limits the number of units that any institution can have available. Improvements need to be made in the instrumentation. For example, a third robotic mitral retractor is needed to retract the posteromedial atrial fold and expose the posterior medial portion of the valve much more effectively than what is currently available. All these issues will ultimately be resolved, and I believe that the robotic approach will continue to provide an alternative to other minimally invasive techniques for mitral valve surgery. \n \nRobotic-assisted mitral valve surgery may eventually become the standard of care in the United States. More work needs to be done to improve surgical outcomes and to reduce postoperative complications.

The objective was to identify the factors that affect nursing care of patients who undergo robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery (RALS).\n\n\nBACKGROUND\nThe rapid introduction of technological innovations into the healthcare system has created new challenges for perioperative nurses. RALS affects the physical and interpersonal context of the surgical team's work and subsequent patient outcomes. Despite significant changes to the workflow for perioperative nurses and CRNAs, there is little research focusing on the nurses' experience and their challenges with RALS.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA qualitative descriptive study METHOD: Semi-structured interview questions guided data collection. A total of seventeen participants including six preoperative and postoperative nurses, seven intraoperative nurses, and four CRNAs in the United States were interviewed. The interviews were conducted between April 26 and June 24, 2018. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis, and the COREQ checklist was used to report data collection, analysis, and the results.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThree major themes and two categories within each theme were identified: (a) surgical innovation: nurse perception and workflow; (b) interprofessional practice: teamwork and standards; and (c) outcome: patient outcomes and system outcomes.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe findings indicate that RALS has the potential to improve patient outcomes when performed in a timely fashion by skilled surgeons, and efficient, well-trained surgical teams. For patients to experience full benefits of RALS, patient characteristics, the underlying reason for surgery, and cost must be considered.\n\n\nRELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE\nThe results of this study highlight the necessity of promoting factors that improve the surgical team training and practice for RALS and ultimately impact patient outcomes.","authors":"Zohreh Schuessler, Anne Scott Stiles, P.

Methods: We collected a total of 54 consecutive patients who underwent robot-assisted TME by two surgical robots from January 2016 to October 2020. We used propensity score matching (PSM) to create balanced cohorts of Micro Hand S group (n = 14) and da Vinci group (n = 14). Robotic installation and operation time, hospital and surgery costs, and intraoperative and postoperative clinical outcomes were compared. Results: In terms of robotic installation time, the Micro Hand S robot took longer than the da Vinci robot (24.2 \u00b1 9.4 min vs. 17.1 \u00b1 5.1 min, P < 0.05). As for the costs, the Micro Hand S group had lower total hospital costs (87,040.1 \u00b1 24,676.9 yuan vs. 125,292.3 \u00b1 17,706.7 yuan, P < 0.05) and surgery costs (25,772.3 \u00b1 4,117.0 yuan vs. 46,940.9 \u00b1 10,199.7 yuan, P < 0.05) than the da Vinci group. There were no statistically significant differences (P > 0.05) in other indicators, including total operation time, robotic operation time, blood loss, time to first liquid diet, time of getting out of bed, and hospital stay.

The objective of the current study is to assess pedicle screw accuracy and clinical outcomes among two of the first operative cases utilizing the ExcelsiusGPS\u00ae robotic system and describe a novel metric to quantify screw deviation.MethodsTwo patients who underwent lumbar fusion at a single institution with the ExcelsiusGPS\u00ae surgical robot were included. Pre-operative trajectory planning was performed from an intra-operative CT scan using the O-arm (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). After robotic-assisted screw implantation, a post-operative CT scan was obtained to confirm ideal screw placement and accuracy with the planned trajectory. A novel pedicle screw accuracy algorithm was devised to measure screw tip\/tail deviation distance and angular offset on axial and sagittal planes. Screw accuracy was concurrently determined by a blinded neuroradiologist using the traditional Gertzbein-Robbins method. Clinical variables such as symptomatology, operative data, and post-operative follow-up were also collected.ResultsEight pedicle screws were placed in two L4-L5 fusion cases. Mean screw tip deviation was 2.1\u00a0mm (range 0.8\u20135.2\u00a0mm), mean tail deviation was 3.2\u00a0mm (range 0.9\u20135.4\u00a0mm), and mean angular offset was 2.4 degrees (range 0.7\u20133.8 degrees). All eight screws were accurately placed based on the Gertzbein-Robbins scale (88% Grade A and 12% Grade B). There were no cases of screw revision or new post-operative deficit. Both patients experienced improvement in Frankel grade and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score by 6\u00a0weeks post-op.ConclusionThe ExcelsiusGPS\u00ae robot allows for precise execution of an intended pre-planned trajectory and accurate screw placement in the first patients to undergo robotic-assisted fusion with this technology.","authors":"B.

Learning curves to achieve surgical competency in robotic-assisted techniques have shown significant variation in learning curve lengths and outcomes. This study aimed to summarize the current literature on learning curves for RAMIE.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA systematic review was conducted in line with PRISMA guidelines. Electronic databases PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library were searched, and articles reporting on learning curves in RAMIE were identified and scrutinized. Studies were eligible if they reported changes in operative outcomes over time, or learning curves, for surgeons newly adopting RAMIE.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifteen studies reporting on 1767 patients were included. Nine studies reported on surgeons with prior experience of robot-assisted surgery prior to adopting RAMIE, with only four studies outlining a specified RAMIE adoption pathway. Learning curves were most commonly analyzed using cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) and were typically reported for lymph node yields and operative times, with significant variation in learning curve lengths (18-73 cases and 20-80 cases, respectively). Most studies reported adoption without significant impact on clinical outcomes such as anastomotic leak; significant learning curves were more likely in studies, which did not report a formal learning or adoption pathway.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nReported RAMIE adoption phases are variable, with some authors suggesting significant impact to patients. With robust training through formal programmes or proctorship, however, others report RAMIE adoption without impact on clinical outcomes. A formalized adoption curriculum appears critical to prevent adverse effects on operative efficiency and patient care.","authors":"O. Pickering, G. V. van Boxel, N. Carter, S. Mercer, B. Knight, P.

For any new operative approach to become an accepted alternative to conventional methods, it must be proved safe and result in comparable outcomes. The purpose of this study is to compare the short-term operative as well as oncologic outcomes of robotic-assisted and laparoscopic rectal cancer resections. Methods This is a prospective randomized clinical trial conducted on patients with rectal cancer undergoing either robotic-assisted or laparoscopic surgery from April 2015 till February 2017. Patients' demographics, operative parameters, and short-term clinical and oncological outcomes were analyzed. Results Fifty-seven patients underwent permuted block randomization. Of these patients, 28 were assigned to undergo robotic-assisted rectal surgery and 29 to laparoscopic rectal surgery. After exclusion of 12 patients following randomization, 45 patients were included in the analysis. No significant differences exist between both groups in terms of age, gender, BMI, ASA score, clinical stage, and rate of receiving upfront chemoradiation. Estimated blood loss was evidently lower in the robotic than in the laparoscopic group (median: 200 versus 325\u2009ml, p= 0.050). A significantly more distal margin is achieved in the robotic than in the laparoscopic group (median: 2.8 versus 1.8, p< 0.001). Although the circumferential radial margin (CRM) was complete in 18 patients (85.7%) in the robotic group in contrast to 15 patients (62.5%) in the laparoscopic group, it did not differ statistically (p=0.079). The overall postoperative complication rates were similar between the two groups. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first prospective randomized trial of robotic rectal surgery in the Middle East and Northern Africa region. Our early experience indicates that robotic rectal surgery is a feasible and safe procedure. It is not inferior to standard laparoscopy in terms of oncologic radicality and surgical complications.

Data for this study was prospectively collected for 23 (two bilateral) patients who underwent robotic-assisted PFA between April 2017 and May 2018. All preoperative implant position planning and postoperative actual implant position were recorded. Presence of trochlear dysplasia and functional outcome scores were also collected. There were 17 (two bilateral) female and 6 male patients with a mean age of 66.5 (range: 41\u201389) years. The mean follow-up period was 30 (range: 24\u201337) months. Eighteen knees (72%) had evidence of trochlear dysplasia. The anterior trochlear line was on average, 7.71 (range: 3.3\u201311.3) degrees, internally rotated to the surgical transepicondylar axis and on average 2.9 (range: 0.2\u20136.5) degrees internally rotated to the posterior condylar line. The preoperative planning range was 4-degree internal to 4-degree external rotation, 4-degree varus to 6-degree valgus, and 7-degree flexion to 3-degree extension. The average difference between preoperative planning and intraoperative implant position was 0.43 degrees for rotation (r\u2009=\u20090.93), 0.99 degrees for varus\/valgus (r\u2009=\u20090.29), 1.26 degrees for flexion\/extension (r\u2009=\u20090.83), and 0.34\u2009mm for proudness (r\u2009=\u20090.80). Six patients (24%) had a different size component from their preoperative plan (r\u2009=\u20090.98). The mean preoperative Oxford Knee Score (OKS) was 16 and the mean postoperative OKS was 42.

Technological innovation is a constantly evolving field. Several companies have been developing new robotic systems that incorporate new technology. This competition among companies in the development of such systems is anticipated to lead to further improvements in patient outcomes as well as drive down the cost of RALS, which is one main concern of this new technique.","authors":"T.

Questions\/purposes The purpose of this study was to compare results from a randomized clinical trial (RCT) at a minimum followup of 10 years between robot-assisted and hand-rasped stem implantation techniques with regard to (1) Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) clinical outcomes scores, and (2) aseptic loosening, revision surgery, and heterotopic ossification. Methods This is a concise followup of a previously reported RCT. In that trial, robot-assisted primary THA was performed on 75 hips (69 patients), and a hand-rasping technique was used on 71 hips (61 patients). Five experienced surgeons at two institutions participated in this trial; all THAs were performed through the posterolateral approach and the patients were treated similarly apart from the method used to prepare the femur. In all, 115 of 130 (88%) of patients initially randomized were available for followup at a minimum of 10 years (mean, 135 months; range, 120\u2013152 months). There was no differential loss to followup between the study groups, and the final study groups here included 64 hips in 59 patients in the robotic group, and 64 hips in 56 patients in the hand-milling group. There were no differences between the study groups in terms of age, sex, diagnosis, body-mass index, or baseline JOA scores. The primary study endpoint was the JOA score, which is scored from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing better function and less pain. Secondary outcomes were revision surgery, and radiographic signs of aseptic loosening and heterotopic ossification as assessed using the four-grade Brooker scale by individuals other than the operating surgeon. Results At a minimum of 10 years postoperatively, there were no differences between patients treated with robot-assisted surgery or hand rasping in JOA scores (97 \u00b1 5 versus 96 \u00b1 7, mean difference 1.4; p = 0.159). No stems in either group developed aseptic loosening, and there were no revisions in either group. There was no difference between the groups in heterotopic ossification (19 of 64 [30%] in the robot-assisted group versus 12 of 64 [19%] in the hand-rasping group; p = 0.186), severe heterotopic ossification was uncommon in both groups, and no hips developed Grade 4 heterotopic ossification in either group. Conclusions Clinically and radiographically, THAs performed with robotic milling for stem implantation did not result in better 10-year clinical outcomes scores, or a lower risk of loosening or revision, compared with hand-rasping. We recommend against widespread adoption of robotic milling for stem implantation in primary cementless THAs. Level of Evidence Level II, therapeutic study.","authors":"N. Nakamura, N. Sugano, T.

METHODS This is a propensity score-matched case-control study, comparing three treatment arms: robotic gastrectomy (RG), laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG), open gastrectomy (OG). Data collection started after sharing a specific study protocol. Data were recorded through a tailored and protected web-based system. Primary outcomes: harvested lymph nodes, estimated blood loss, hospital stay, complications rate. Among the secondary outcomes, there are: operative time, R0 resections, POD of mobilization, POD of starting liquid diet and soft solid diet. The analysis includes the evaluation of type and grade of postoperative complications. Detailed information of anastomotic leakages is also provided. RESULTS The present analysis was carried out of 1026 gastrectomies. To guarantee homogenous distribution of cases, patients in the RG, LG and OG groups were 1:1:2 matched using a propensity score analysis with a caliper = 0.2. The successful matching resulted in a total sample of 604 patients (RG = 151; LG = 151; OG = 302). The three groups showed no differences in all baseline patients characteristics, type of surgery (P = 0.42) and stage of the disease (P = 0.16). Intraoperative blood loss was significantly lower in the LG (95.93 \u00b1 119.22) and RG (117.91 \u00b1 68.11) groups compared to the OG (127.26 \u00b1 79.50, P = 0.002). The mean number of retrieved lymph nodes was similar between the RG (27.78 \u00b1 11.45), LG (24.58 \u00b1 13.56) and OG (25.82 \u00b1 12.07) approach. A benefit in favor of the minimally invasive approaches was found in the length of hospital stay (P < 0.0001). A similar complications rate was found (P = 0.13). The leakage rate was not different (P = 0.78) between groups. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic and robotic surgery can be safely performed and proposed as possible alternative to open surgery. The main highlighted benefit is a faster postoperative functional recovery.","authors":"A. Parisi, D. Reim, F. Borghi, N. Nguyen, F. Qi, A. Coratti, F. Cianchi, M. Cesari, F. Bazzocchi, O.

Materials and Methods: The first 50 cases of two robotic surgeons were reviewed retrospectively. Group 1 consisted of the first 50 cases of the surgeon with previous experience as a robotic bedside assistant between September 2016-July 2018, while Group 2 included the first 50 cases of the surgeon with no bedside assistant experience between February 2009-December 2009. Groups were examined in terms of demographics, prostate volume, presence of median lobe, prostate specific antigen (PSA), preoperative Gleason score, positive core number, clinical stage, console surgery time, estimated blood loss, postoperative Gleason score, pathological stage, positive surgical margin rate, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay and biochemical recurrence rate. Results: Previous abdominal surgery and the presence of median lobe hypertrophy rates were higher in Group 1 than in Group 2 (20% vs. 4%, p=0.014; 24% vs. 6%, p=0.012; respectively). In addition, patients in Group 1 were in a higher clinical stage than those in Group 2 (cT2: 70% vs. 28%, p=0.001). Median console surgery time and median length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in Group 1 than in Group 2 (170 min vs. 240 min, p=0.001; 3 vs. 4, p=0.022; respectively). Clavien grade 3 complication rate was higher in Group 2 but was statistically insignificant. Conclusion: Our findings might reflect that previous bedside assistant experience led to an increase in self-confidence and the ability to manage troubleshooting and made it more likely for surgeons to start with more difficult cases with more challenging patients. It is recommended that novice surgeons serve as bedside assistants before moving on to consoles.","authors":"H. Cimen, Y. Atik, Deniz Gul, B. Uysal, M.

Its safety and effectiveness have not been adequately evaluated in minimally invasive cardiac surgery. The authors hypothesized that intrathecal morphine would decrease postoperative morphine consumption after minimally invasive cardiac surgery. Methods: In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial, patients undergoing robotic totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass received either intrathecal morphine (5 mcg\/kg) or intrathecal saline before surgery. The primary outcome was postoperative morphine equivalent consumption in the first 24 h after surgery; secondary outcomes included pain scores, side effects, and patient satisfaction. Pain was assessed via visual analog scale at 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after intensive care unit arrival. Opioid-related side effects (nausea\/vomiting, pruritus, urinary retention, respiratory depression) were assessed daily. Patient satisfaction was evaluated with the Revised American Pain Society Outcome Questionnaire. Results: Seventy-nine patients were randomized to receive intrathecal morphine (n = 37) or intrathecal placebo (n = 42), with 70 analyzed (morphine 33, placebo 37). Intrathecal morphine patients required significantly less median (25th to 75th percentile) morphine equivalents compared to placebo during first postoperative 24 h (28 [16 to 46] mg vs. 59 [41 to 79] mg; difference, \u201328 [95% CI, \u201340 to \u201318]; P < 0.001) and second postoperative 24 h (0 [0 to 2] mg vs. 5 [0 to 6] mg; difference, \u20133.3 [95% CI, \u20135 to 0]; P < 0.001), exhibited significantly lower visual analog scale pain scores at rest and cough at all postoperative timepoints (overall treatment effect, \u20134.1 [95% CI, \u20134.9 to \u20133.3] and \u20134.7 [95% CI, \u20135.5 to \u20133.9], respectively; P < 0.001), and percent time in severe pain (10 [0 to 40] vs. 40 [20 to 70]; P = 0.003) during the postoperative period. Mild nausea was more common in the intrathecal morphine group (36% vs. 8%; P = 0.004). Conclusions: When given before induction of anesthesia for totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass, intrathecal morphine decreases use of postoperative opioids and produces significant postoperative analgesia for 48 h. Used at a dose of 5 mcg\/kg, intrathecal morphine reduced opioid consumption approximately 50% during the first 24 postoperative hours. Additionally, intrathecal morphine reduced pain at rest and with cough for 48 h, although mild nausea was more common among those receiving morphine than those receiving sham saline injections.","authors":"R.

It arose from an interest in reducing patient trauma by operating through smaller incisions with videoscopic assistance. In the United States, following two clinical trials, the FDA approved the daVinci Surgical System in 2002 for intra-cardiac surgery. This device has undergone three iterations, eventuating in the current daVinci XI. At present it is the only robotic device approved for mitral valve surgery. Many larger centers have adopted its use as part of their routine mitral valve repair armamentarium. Although these operations have longer perfusion and arrest times, complications have been either similar or less than other traditional methods. Preoperative screening is paramount and leads to optimal patient selection and outcomes. There are clear contraindications, both relative and absolute, that must be considered. Three-dimensional (3D) echocardiographic studies optimally guide surgeons in operative planning. Herein, we describe the selection criteria as well as our operative management during a robotic mitral valve repair. Major complications are detailed with tips to avoid their occurrence. Operative outcomes from the author's series as well as those from the largest experiences in the United States are described. They show that robotic mitral valve repair is safe and effective, as well as economically reasonable due to lower costs of hospitalization. Thus, the future of this operative technique is bright for centers adopting the \"heart team\" approach, adequate clinical volume and a dedicated and experienced mitral repair surgeon.","authors":"W.

Results Of 887 articles screened, 44 met the inclusion criteria (range 20\u2013735,537 patients). Four were randomized controlled trials, and four used propensity-matching. There were variable comparisons between operative techniques with only 19 out of 44 studies comparing techniques using the same number of ports. Operating room time was longer for the robot-assisted technique in the majority of studies (range 11\u201355 min for 22 studies, p < 0.05; 15 studies showed no difference; two studies showed shorter laparoscopic times), while conversion rates and intraoperative complications were not different.

We performed a retrospective analysis of patients from the National Cancer Database diagnosed with clinical Stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC from 2010-2016. We examined the yearly proportion of MIS versus open resections. Multivariable regression was used to assess the association of surgical approach with length of stay, unplanned readmissions, 30-day and 90-day mortality.

We identified 5741 patients who underwent lobectomy for Stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC (459 robotic, 1403 VATS, 3879 open). From 2010-2016, the proportion of minimally invasive procedures increased from 20% to 45%. MIS patients, on average, stayed 1 day less in the hospital (95% CI 0.7,1.5) and had lower odds of 90-day (OR 0.74 95% CI 0.54,0.99) and 5-year mortality (OR 0.82 95% CI 0.75,0.91), compared to open resections.

To maximize the efficacy and minimize the invasiveness of laparoscopic surgery, researchers have sought to implement wider application of robotics. Nevertheless, both optimism without sound evidence and fear of new technology obscure the appropriate uses of robotic surgery. In the present review, we attempted to provide a balanced perspective on the current state of robotic gastrectomy, outlining evidence and opportunities for the use thereof. Although evidence is limited, the use of robotics is feasible for gastric cancer surgery, and less than 10 cases of robotic surgery are needed to become proficient therein. Compared to the clinical impact of laparoscopy on gastric cancer surgery, the additional benefits of robotic surgery to patients seem to be limited. Despite additional costs and longer surgeries, robotic surgery reportedly does not offer surgical outcomes superior to those for laparoscopic surgery, according to a recent multicenter study. Meanwhile, however, our in-depth review of retrospective and prospective reports revealed that robots could expand the indications of minimally invasive gastrectomy for patients requiring total gastrectomy and D2 lymph node dissection. Moreover, we found that robotic gastrectomy is associated with a higher number of retrieved lymph nodes, less bleeding, fewer complications, and shorter hospital stay, compared to laparoscopic gastrectomy. Accordingly, new surgical approaches using advanced technologies, such as near infrared detectors, the Tilepro\u00ae multi-input display, dual consoles, and the Single-Site\u00ae system, are under investigation. In conclusion, measuring the additional benefits of robotic over laparoscopic surgery would be difficult and clinically insignificant.

A systematic review was performed to provide a synopsis of the literature, focusing on clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness.\n\n\nMETHOD\nStructured searches of MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases were performed in August 2013. All original studies except case-reports were included in qualitative review. Studies with \u226550 patients were presented quantitatively.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter applying inclusion and exclusion criteria to the search results, 27 studies were included in qualitative review, 16 of which had \u226550 patients. All studies were observational in nature, and thus the quality of evidence was rated low to medium. Patients generally had good left ventricular performance, were relatively asymptomatic, and mean patient age ranged from 52.6-58.4 years. Rates of intraoperative outcomes ranged from: 0.0-9.1% for conversion to non-robotic surgery, 106\u00b122 to 188.5\u00b153.8 min for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time and 79\u00b116 to 140\u00b140 min for cross-clamp (XC) time. Rates of short-term postoperative outcomes ranged from: 0.0-3.0% for mortality, 0.0-3.2% for myocardial infarction (MI), 0.0-3.0% for permanent stroke, 1.6-15% for pleural effusion, 0.0-5.0% for reoperations for bleeding, 0.0-0.3% for infection, and 1.1-6% for prolonged ventilation (>48 hours), 1.5-5.4% for early repair failure, 12.3\u00b16.7 to 36.6\u00b124.7 hours for intensive care length of stay, 3.1\u00b10.3 to 6.3\u00b13.9 days for hospital length of stay (HLOS) and 81.7-97.6% had no or trivial mitral regurgitation (MR) before discharge.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAll subtypes of mitral valve prolapse are repairable with robotic techniques. CPB and XC times are long, and novel techniques such as the Cor-Knot, Nitinol clips or running sutures may reduce the time required. The overall rates of early postoperative mortality and morbidity are low. Improvements in postoperative quality of life (QoL) and expeditious return to work offset the increase in equipment and intraoperative cost. Evidence for long-term outcomes is as yet limited.","authors":"M. Seco, C. Cao, P. Modi, P. Bannon, M. Wilson, M. Vallely, K. Phan, M. Misfeld, F. Mohr, T.

Background: There is a lack of proven clinical benefit of robotic total mesorectal excision (TME) compared with a laparoscopic approach in the setting of multicenter RCTs. Methods: Between July 2011 and February 2016, patients diagnosed with an adenocarcinoma located <10 cm from the anal verge and clinically rated T1-4aNxM0 were enrolled. The primary outcome was the completeness of TME assessed by a surgeon and a pathologist. Results: The RCT was terminated prematurely because of poor accrual of data. In all, 295 patients were assigned randomly to a robot-assisted TME group (151 in R-TME) or a laparoscopy-assisted TME group (144 in L-TME). The rates of complete TME were not different between groups (80.7% in R-TME, 77.1% in L-TME). Pathologic outcomes including the circumferential resection margin and the numbers of retrieved lymph nodes were not different between groups. In a subanalysis, the positive circumferential resection margin rate was lower in the R-TME group (0% vs 6.1% for L-TME; P=0.031). Among the recovery parameters, the length of opioid use was shorter in the R-TME group (P=0.028). There was no difference in the postoperative complication rate between the groups (12.0% for R-TME vs 8.3% for L-TME).

The aim of this study was to compare the short-term outcomes of robotic-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE), video-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy (VAMIE), and open esophagectomy (OE). Methods Our study included patients who had undergone McKeown esophagectomy at Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital between January 2016 and December 2018. We analyzed clinical baseline data, as well as perioperative and pathological outcomes. Results A total of 312 cases met the inclusion criteria (OE: 77, VAMIE: 144, RAMIE: 91). The OE group had a greater number of late-stage patients as well as those who received the neo-adjuvant therapy, compared with the other two groups (P=0.001). The procedure time in the OE group was also shorter by approximately 20 minutes (P=0.021). Total blood loss was significantly lower in the two MIE groups (P=0.004) than in the OE group. There were no differences in the total number of dissected lymph nodes between the three groups (OE: 24.09\u00b110.77, VAMIE: 23.07\u00b110.18, RAMIE: 22.84\u00b18.37, P=0.680). Both the lymph node number (P=0.155) and achievement rate (P=0.190) in the right recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) area were comparable between the three groups. However, in the left RLN area, minimally invasive approaches resulted in a higher number of harvested lymph nodes (P=0.032) and greater achievement rate (P=0.018). Neither MIE procedure increased the incidence of postoperative complications. Conclusions Minimally invasive surgery could guarantee the quality of bilateral RLN lymphadenectomy without increasing postoperative complications, especially in RAMIE patients. The rational choice of different surgical approaches would improve both safety and oncological outcomes for patients.","authors":"L. Gong, Hongjing Jiang, J. Yue, X. Duan, P. Tang, P.

It has been hypothesized that the use of robotics enhances the accuracy of prosthesis positioning and alignment restoration. The objective of this study was to provide a high-level, evidence-based comparison between robotic total knee replacements and conventional methods, focusing on radiological and functional outcomes. Methods We searched five databases from their inception until June 1, 2022, specifically targeting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the outcomes of robotic and conventional total knee replacements. We were interested in outcomes such as knee range of motion, clinical and function knee society scores, the Western Ontario and McMaster University score (WOMAC), the Hospital of Special Surgery score, complications, and radiological alignment. This review was carried out in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes guidelines. We assessed the risk of bias using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2). Results Our search returned seven RCTs suitable for our analysis, which included a total of 1942 knees; 974 of these knees were implanted using robotic arms while the remaining 968 utilized jig-based knee systems. Our findings indicated that robotic knees had significantly better post-operative anatomical (OR \u2212\u20090.82; 95% CI, \u2212\u20091.027 to \u2212\u20090.58, p value\u2009<\u20090.00001) and mechanical restoration (OR \u2212\u20090.95; 95% CI, \u2212\u20091.49 to \u2212\u20090.41, p value\u2009<\u20090.0006). While knee range of motion (OR \u2212\u20092.23; 95% CI \u2212\u20094.89\u20130.43, p value 0.1) and femoral prosthesis position (OR \u2212\u20090.98; 95% CI, \u2212\u20092.03\u20130.08, p value 0.07) also favored robotic knees, these differences did not reach statistical significance. Both clinical and functional outcomes, as well as the rate of complications, were found to be statistically similar between the groups undergoing robotic and traditional knee replacement surgeries. Conclusion This meta-analysis indicates that robotic total knee replacements offer superior post-operative anatomical and mechanical alignment compared to conventional total knee replacements. Despite this, clinical and functional outcomes, as well as complication rates, were similar between the two. These findings should be considered in light of potential confounding factors. More randomized controlled trials with the latest robotic systems are needed to confirm any superior functional and clinical outcomes from robotic-assisted surgeries.

Results When compared to standard laparoscopic approaches, robotic surgery for large PEHs may offer benefits in terms of decreased conversion rate and shorter hospital stay. Some studies found a decrease in need for esophageal lengthening procedures and fewer long-term recurrences. The perioperative complication rate is similar between the two techniques in most studies; however, one large study of nearly 170,000 patients in the early years of robotics adoption demonstrated a higher rate of esophageal perforation and respiratory failure in the robotic group (2.2% increase in absolute risk).

The aim of this study was to present the current evidence for robotic-assisted UKA and describe the outcome in terms of implant positioning, range of movement (ROM), function and survival, and the types of robot and implants that are currently used.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA search of PubMed and Medline was performed in October 2018 in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis statement. Search terms included \"robotic\", \"knee\", and \"surgery\". The criteria for inclusion was any study describing the use of robotic UKA and reporting implant positioning, ROM, function, and survival for clinical, cadaveric, or dry bone studies.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 528 articles were initially identified from the databases and reference lists. Following full text screening, 38 studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria were included. In all, 20 studies reported on implant positioning, 18 on functional outcomes, 16 on survivorship, and six on ROM. The Mako (Stryker, Mahwah, New Jersey) robot was used in 32 studies (84%), the BlueBelt Navio (Blue Belt Technologies, Plymouth, Minnesota) in three (8%), the Sculptor RGA (Stanmore Implants, Borehamwood United Kingdom) in two (5%), and the Acrobot (The Acrobot Co.

The novel features of the new da Vinci Xi increase operational flexibility and maneuverability and are expected to facilitate the performance of multiquadrant surgery. Methods. Between December 2011 and May 2015, 120 patients with colon or rectal cancer were operated on using the Si robotic system (the Si group).

The mean operation time was 183 \u00b1 29.37 minutes, and the mean estimated blood loss was 27 \u00b1 9.75 mL. The time to clear liquid intake was 3 days in all patients, and the mean length of stay after surgery was 6.2 \u00b1 0.55 days. No patient required conversion to conventional laparoscopic surgery. There were no perioperative complications. According to the pathology report, the mean number of harvested lymph nodes was 36.6 \u00b1 4.45. Four patients were stage III, and 1 patient was stage II according to the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer system. Conclusion Totally-robotic right colectomy via the suprapubic approach can be performed successfully in selected patients. Further comparative studies are required to verify the clinical advantages of our technique over conventional robotic surgery.","authors":"Hee Jae Lee, G. Choi, Jun Seok Park, S. Park, H. J. Kim, I.

Technical limitations explain at least in part the reasons of a relatively poor adoption of laparoscopy for rectal resection, in particular for low tumors in a deep and narrow pelvis. Robotics is intended to overcome these limitations. Potentially better short-term outcomes have been published: reduced conversion rates, better functional outcomes, shorter learning curve, reduction of positive margins, better specimen\u2026 However, robotic surgery has not yet taken over as the gold standard approach for low anterior resection. Several drawbacks might indeed discourage the most fervent surgeon: the size of the robot, the lack of tactile feedback, the risk and difficulties during multiquadrant surgery, and, of course, costs. Whilst new systems might overcome most of these drawbacks, it seems obvious that the development of robotic surgery is underway. Robotics is not just another interesting technical tool, but more a new concept, which should play a role in the future.","authors":"N.

The present multicenter study assessed the perioperative outcomes of RT and compared physician perspectives on the musculoskeletal ergonomic parameters associated with OT, endoscopic thyroidectomy (ET), and RT.Materials and MethodsWe reviewed the medical records of 2014 consecutive patients who underwent RT, conducted by 7 surgeons, at 4 centers between October 2007 and June 2010. Patient characteristics, perioperative clinical results, complications, and pathologic outcomes were analyzed. Moreover, surgeons were surveyed to gather data on musculoskeletal discomfort experienced during OT, ET, and RT.ResultsOf the 2014 patients, 740 underwent total and 1274 subtotal thyroidectomy. Mean tumor diameter was 0.8\u00a0cm, and the mean number of retrieved central lymph nodes was 4.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.9 (range 0\u201328). The rates of permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve injury and permanent hypocalcemia were 0.4 and 0.05%, respectively. Neck and\/or back pain after OT, ET, and RT was experienced by 100, 85.7, and 28.6% of surgeons, respectively. When surgeons ranked the operative approaches in decreasing order of associated pain, 57.1% indicated ET\u00a0>\u00a0OT\u00a0>\u00a0RT, 28.6% selected OT\u00a0>\u00a0ET\u00a0>\u00a0RT, and 14.3% responded ET\u00a0>\u00a0RT\u00a0>\u00a0OT.ConclusionRT is a feasible and safe procedure that may facilitate radical cervical lymph node dissection. Moreover, for surgeons, the RT resulted in less musculoskeletal discomfort than did OT or ET. A larger prospective study, with a longer follow-up, is needed to determine whether RT offers real benefits for both patients and surgeons.","authors":"Jandee Lee, Sang-Wook Kang, Jeong Ju Jung, Un Jung Choi, J.

The question addressed was 'Is robotic mitral valve surgery more expensive than its conventional counterpart?' Altogether 19 papers were found using the reported search, of which 5 represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. There is a general impression in the surgical community that robotic operations might incur prohibitive additional costs. There is a paucity of data in the literature regarding cost analysis in cardiac robotic surgery. From the five studies, four were single institution experiences and one was a database inquiry study. These four studies showed that operational costs are higher for robotic cases but this was partially (one study) or completely (three studies) offset by lower postoperative costs. Overall hospital costs were similar between the two approaches in three studies and one study showed higher costs in the robotic group. Higher operating theatre (OT) costs were driven mainly by use of robotic instruments (approximately US$1500 per case) and longer OT times. Savings in postoperative care were driven by shorter length of hospital stay (on average 2 days fewer in robotic cases) and lower morbidity. If amortization cost, that is, the value of the initial capital investment on the robotic system divided by all operations performed, is included in this analysis, robotic approach becomes significantly more expensive by approximately US$3400 per case. The fifth study was a large national database inquiry in which robotic approach was found to be more expensive by US$600 per case excluding amortization cost and by US$3700 if amortization is included. We conclude that the total hospital cost of robotic mitral valve surgery is slightly higher than conventional sternotomy surgery. If amortization is taken into consideration, robotic cases are considerably more expensive.","authors":"L. Canale, A.

Our systematic review was conducted on 682 patients with robotic liver resection, and 1101 patients were operated by laparoscopic platform. Robotic surgery has a long surgical duration (MD = 43.99, 95% CI: 23.45\u201364.53, p = 0.0001), while there is no significant difference in length of hospital stay (MD = 0.10, 95% CI: \u22120.38\u20130.58, p = 0.69), blood loss (MD = \u221220, 95% CI: \u221264.90\u201323.34, p = 0.36), the incidence of conversion (OR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.41\u20131.69, p = 0.62), and tumor size (MD = 0.30, 95% CI: \u22120\u20130.60, p = 0.05); the subgroup analysis of major and minor hepatectomy on operation time is (MD = \u22127.08, 95% CI: \u221215.22\u20130.07, p = 0.09) and (MD = 39.87, 95% CI: \u22121.70\u201381.44, p = 0.06), respectively. However, despite the deficiencies of robotic hepatectomy in terms of extended operation time compared to laparoscopic hepatectomy, robotic hepatectomy is still effective and equivalent to laparoscopic hepatectomy in outcomes. Scientific evaluation and research on one portion of the liver may produce more efficacity and more precise results. Therefore, more clinical trials are needed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of robotic compared to laparoscopic hepatectomy.","authors":"Taslim Aboudou, Mei-xuan Li, Zeliang Zhang, Zhengfeng Wang, Yan-fei Li, Lufang Feng, Xiajing Chu, Nan Chen, Wence Zhou, Kehu Yang","year":2022,"url":"https:\/\/www.semanticscholar.org\/paper\/17edc7e8c9f8f462b75da3cc0230da9c19ec1368"},{"title":"Computer-assisted and Robotic Surgery in Orthopedics: Where We Are in 2014","abstract":null,"authors":"V.

The objective of this meta-analysis was to compare the safety and efficacy of robotic-assisted colorectal surgery (RCS) and laparoscopic colorectal surgery (LCS) for colorectal disease based on randomized controlled trial studies.MethodsLiterature searches of electronic databases (Pubmed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library) were performed to identify randomized controlled trial studies that compared the clinical or oncologic outcomes of RCS and LCS. This meta-analysis was performed using the Review Manager (RevMan) software (version 5.2) that is provided by the Cochrane Collaboration. The data used were mean differences and odds ratios for continuous and dichotomous variables, respectively. Fixed-effects or random-effects models were adopted according to heterogeneity.ResultsFour randomized controlled trial studies were identified for this meta-analysis. In total, 110 patients underwent RCS, and 116 patients underwent LCS. The results revealed that estimated blood losses (EBLs), conversion rates and times to the recovery of bowel function were significantly reduced following RCS compared with LCS. There were no significant differences in complication rates, lengths of hospital stays, proximal margins, distal margins or harvested lymph nodes between the two techniques.ConclusionsRCS is a promising technique and is a safe and effective alternative to LCS for colorectal surgery. The advantages of RCS include reduced EBLs, lower conversion rates and shorter times to the recovery of bowel function. Further studies are required to define the financial effects of RCS and the effects of RCS on long-term oncologic outcomes.","authors":"Guixiang Liao, Zhihong Zhao, Shuhui Lin, Rong Li, Yawei Yuan, Shasha Du, Jiarong Chen, H.

The first cohort consisted of 43 patients with cemented lateral UKA performed with the conventional procedure (Conventional group). The second cohort consisted of 52 patients who received robot-assisted cemented lateral UKA (Robotic group). Clinical evaluation of the two samples entailed evaluating the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score divided into subscales (symptoms and stiffness, pain, function in daily living, function in sport and recreation and quality of life) for each patient. Revision was defined as the failure of the implant (periprosthetic joint infection, periprosthetic fracture or aseptic loosening), and survival was based on implant revision. Results The mean follow-up time was 90.3\u2009\u00b1\u20099.1\u00a0months for the Conventional Group and 95.4\u2009\u00b1\u200911.0\u00a0months for the Robotic Group (n.s.).

A micro-cost analysis","abstract":"Higher capital costs and operating room costs associated with Lobectomy via Robot Assisted Thoracic Surgery (RATS) have previously been suggested as the principal contributors to the elevated overall cost. This study uses a micro-costing approach to a previous analysis of clinical outcomes of RATS, Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) and Open Lobectomy to evaluate the most significant cost drivers for the higher cost of robot-assisted lobectomy. A micro-costing model was developed to reflect the pathway of patients from day of surgery through the first 30 days following lobectomy. Costs were provided for RATS, VATS and Open approaches. Sensitivity analysis was performed specifically in the area of staff costs. A threshold sensitivity analysis of the overall cost components was also performed. Total cost per case for the RATS approach was \u20ac13,321 for the VATS approach \u20ac11,567, and for the Open approach \u20ac12,582. The overall cost differences were driven primarily by the elevated consumable costs associated with RATS Lobectomy. Capital costs account for a relatively small proportion of the per-case cost difference. This study presents a detailed analysis of the cost drivers for lobectomy, modelled for the three primary surgical approaches. We believe this is a useful tool for surgeons, hospital management, and service commissioning agencies to accurately and comprehensively determine where cost savings can be applied in their programme to improve the cost-effectiveness of RATS lobectomy.","authors":"Ben Shanahan, U.

This prospective single-centre cohort study described TORS in selected tumours of the tongue base in order to assess safety, efficacy and functional outcome of the procedure. From October 2010 to February 2012, TORS was performed in 13 consecutive patients affected by T1-T2 tumours of the base of the tongue. This procedure was applicable in all cases. The clinical stage demonstrated 8 T1 tumours and 5 T2 tumours. Neck node metastases were clinically evident in 6 cases (7 N0, 1 N1, 4 N2b and 1 N2c). The final pathology report confirmed malignancy in all cases (11 squamous cell carcinoma and 2 mucoepidermoid carcinoma). Negative-margin resections were obtained in all cases but one with close margins. Synchronous lymph node neck dissections were performed in 7 cases (6 monolateral, 1 bilateral). Patients underwent temporary tracheostomies for a mean time of 6 days. A naso-gastric feeding tube was positioned in 10\/13 (76.9%) patients for a mean time of 7.5 days. The average time to carry out the TORS procedure was 95 min (set-up time 25 min; TORS 70 min). No deaths occurred. Surgical complications were observed in 4 cases (postoperative bleedings in 3 cases and intraoperative anaphylactic shock in 1 case). Median hospital stay was 9 days. All patients had good functional outcomes. Adjuvant treatment was indicated in 5\/13 cases (35.4%). TORS represents a good tool for staging and treating neoplasm of the base of the tongue. The transoral removal is safe and can radically remove limited oropharyngeal tumours of the tongue base with good functional outcomes. The operating costs can be relatively high but they are related to the number of procedures per year, although the advantages to patients seem to justify the procedure. TORS can represent the definitive treatment in selected T1-T2 cases of base of the tongue tumours without adverse features and allow the possibility for the deintensification of adjuvant treatments.","authors":"G.

The mean follow-up time was 25.2 months (range, 16-38 months) for malignant disease. The SCCA sites were in the oropharynx (30\/35), larynx (2\/35), and unknown primary with neck metastasis (3\/35). Unknown primary patients were excluded in the surgical margin analyses. Negative margins were achieved in 91% of cases. The local and regional recurrence rates were 6.3% (2\/32) and 3.1% (1\/32), respectively. Two patients (6.3%) developed distant metastasis. Oropharyngeal SCCA cases were reviewed, of which 23 were human papillomavirus (HPV)\/p16 positive and 7 were HPV\/p16 negative. The 2-year actual survival for HPV-positive and -negative patients was 96% (22\/23) and 86% (6\/7), respectively. The 2-year disease-free survival for HPV-positive and -negative cases was 91% (21\/23) and 71.4% (5\/7), respectively. All malignant cases that underwent TORS received postoperative adjuvant therapy.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTORS is a safe procedure with minimal complications and acceptable clinical and functional outcomes.","authors":"R.

We have compared oncological outcomes and quality of life (QoL) in PTC patients undergoing robotic TT and MRND and those undergoing conventional open procedures.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBetween March 2010 and July 2011, 128 patients with PTC and lateral neck node metastases underwent TT with MRND, including 62 who underwent robotic and 66 who underwent open TT. We compared oncologic outcomes and safety as well as functional outcomes such as postoperative subjective voice and swallowing difficulties. We also evaluated neck pain, sensory changes, and cosmetic satisfaction after surgery using various QoL symptom scales. Neck and shoulder disability was assessed using arm abduction tests (AAT) and questions from the neck dissection impairment index (NDII).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAlthough the mean operating time was significantly longer in the robotic (mean, 271.8 \u00b1 50.2 min) than in the open group (mean, 208.9 \u00b1 56.3 min) (P < .0001), postoperative complication rates and oncologic outcomes, including the results of radioactive iodine scans and postoperative serum Tg concentrations, did not differ significantly. Subjective voice outcomes and postoperative AAT and neck dissection impairment index were also similar, but postoperative swallowing difficulties (P = .0041) and sensory changes (P < .0001) were significantly more frequent in the open than in the robotic group. In particular, mean cosmetic satisfaction score was significantly higher in the robotic than in the open group (P < .0001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRobotic TT with MRND yielded similar oncologic outcomes and safety as conventional open procedures, with similar recovery of neck and shoulder disability. However, the robot technique resulted in better QoL outcomes, including better cosmetic results and reductions in neck sensory changes and swallowing discomfort.","authors":"Jandee Lee, In-Soon Kwon, Eun Hee Bae, W.

Although periprosthetic fractures through tracking pin sites are rare, there is a paucity of literature on this potential complication. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of the current literature to assess the incidence and clinical outcomes of periprosthetic fractures through tracking pin sites following CAN and RA TKA and UKA.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA systematic review was performed following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines using the PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases in April 2020. Studies were assessed for the presence of pin site fractures, fracture characteristics, and clinical outcomes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeventeen clinical studies (5 case series, 1 cohort study, and 11 case reports) involving 29 pin-related fractures were included for review. The overall incidence ranged from 0.06% to 4.8%. The mean time from index arthroplasty to fracture was 9.5 weeks (range, 0 to 40 weeks). The majority of fractures occurred in the femoral diaphysis (59%). Nineteen fractures (66%) were displaced and 10 (34%) were nondisplaced or occult. The majority of cases were atraumatic in nature or involved minor trauma and were typically preceded by persistent leg pain. A transcortical pin trajectory, large pin diameter (>4 mm), diaphyseal fixation, multiple placement attempts, and the use of non-self-drilling, non-self-tapping pins were the most commonly reported risk factors for pin-related periprosthetic fractures following CAN or RA TKA.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSurgeons should maintain a high index of suspicion for pin-related fractures in patients with ongoing leg or thigh pain after CAN or RA TKA in order to avoid fracture displacement and additional morbidity. As CAN and RA TKA have unique complication risks, the debate regarding the value of technology-assisted TKA and its cost-effectiveness continues.\n\n\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE\nTherapeutic Level IV.

Here, the authors present the largest systematic review and meta-analysis to date that specifically addresses patient-centered outcomes, including the risk of inaccurate screw placement and perioperative outcomes in spinal surgeries using robotic instrumentation and\/or augmented reality surgical navigation (ARSN).\n\n\nMETHODS\nA systematic review of the literature in the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases spanning the last decade (January 2011-November 2021) was performed to present all clinical studies comparing robot-assisted instrumentation and ARSN with conventional instrumentation techniques in lumbar spine surgery. The authors compared these two technologies as they relate to screw accuracy, estimated blood loss (EBL), intraoperative time, length of stay (LOS), perioperative complications, radiation dose and time, and the rate of reoperation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 64 studies were analyzed that included 11,113 patients receiving 20,547 screws. Robot-assisted instrumentation was associated with less risk of inaccurate screw placement (p < 0.0001) regardless of control arm approach (freehand, fluoroscopy guided, or navigation guided), fewer reoperations (p < 0.0001), fewer perioperative complications (p < 0.0001), lower EBL (p = 0.0005), decreased LOS (p < 0.0001), and increased intraoperative time (p = 0.0003). ARSN was associated with decreased radiation exposure compared with robotic instrumentation (p = 0.0091) and fluoroscopy-guided (p < 0.0001) techniques.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAltogether, the pooled data suggest that technology-enhanced thoracolumbar instrumentation is advantageous for both patients and surgeons. As the technology progresses and indications expand, it remains essential to continue investigations of both robotic instrumentation and ARSN to validate meaningful benefit over conventional instrumentation techniques in spine surgery.","authors":"M.

Clinical success was defined as resolution of presenting symptoms and improved\/stable hydronephrosis on ultrasound.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRALP and OPN cohorts comprised 52 and 40 patients, respectively. RALP patients were significantly older (6.8 vs 1.2 years, p<0.01) and heavier (28.4 vs 8.4 kg, p<0.01).

Seven type-IIIb Clavien-Dindo complications occurred in RALP patients compared with two in OPN cases. There were no differences in postoperative narcotic administration (p=0.92) or duration of stay in hospital (DOSH) (p=0.93).

An initial learning curve with RALP is to be expected, but operative times for RALP approached those for OPN. Previously reported benefits of RALP (reduced analgesic requirements, DOSH) were not observed. This difference may have been due to comparison of a heterogeneous cohort.

Both are highly reliant upon stereotaxy and either pre- or intraoperative radiographic imaging. While user-operated IG systems have been commercially available longer and subsequently are more widely utilized across centers, robotics systems provide unique theoretical advantages over freehand and IG techniques for placing instrumentation within the spine. While there is a growing plethora of data showing that IG and robotic systems decrease the incidence of malpositioned screws, less is known about their impact on clinical outcomes. Both robotics and IG may be of particular value in cases of substantial deformity or complex anatomy. Indications for the use of these systems continue to expand with an increasing body of literature justifying their use in not only guiding thoracolumbar pedicle screw placement, but also in cases of cervical and pelvic instrumentation as well as spinal tumor resection. Both techniques also offer the potential benefit of reducing occupational exposures to ionizing radiation for the operating room staff, the surgeon, and the patient. As the use of IG and robotics in spine surgery continues to expand, these systems' value in improving surgical accuracy and clinical outcomes must be weighed against concerns over cost and workflow. As newer systems incorporating both real-time IG and robotics become more utilized, further research is necessary to better elucidate situations where these systems may be particularly beneficial in spine surgery.","authors":"R.

Despite encouraging results from case-series reports, there remains a lack of robust clinical evidence for this relatively novel surgical technique. The present systematic review aimed to assess the short- and long-term safety and efficacy of RVATS.\n\n\nMETHODS\nNine relevant and updated studies were identified from 12 institutions using five electronic databases. Endpoints included perioperative morbidity and mortality, conversion rate, operative time, length of hospitalization, intraoperative blood loss, duration of chest drainage, recurrence rate and long-term survival. In addition, cost analyses and quality of life assessments were also systematically evaluated. Comparative outcomes were meta-analyzed when data were available.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll institutions used the same master-slave robotic system (da Vinci, Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, California) and most patients underwent lobectomies for early-stage non-small cell lung cancers. Perioperative mortality rates for patients who underwent pulmonary resection by RVATS ranged from 0-3.8%, whilst overall morbidity rates ranged from 10-39%. Two propensity-score analyses compared patients with malignant disease who underwent pulmonary resection by RVATS or thoracotomy, and a meta-analysis was performed to identify a trend towards fewer complications after RVATS. In addition, one cost analysis and one quality of life study reported improved outcomes for RVATS when compared to open thoracotomy.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nResults of the present systematic review suggest that RVATS is feasible and can be performed safely for selected patients in specialized centers. Perioperative outcomes including postoperative complications were similar to historical accounts of conventional VATS. A steep learning curve for RVATS was identified in a number of institutional reports, which was most evident in the first 20 cases.

Prior to attempting live surgery, virtual reality (VR) simulators afford opportunities for training surgeons to learn fundamental technical skills. Herein, we evaluate the association of suturing technical skill assessments between VR simulation and live surgery, and functional clinical outcomes. Materials and Methods 20 surgeons completed a VR suturing exercise on the MimicTM Flex VR simulator and the anterior vesicourethral anastomosis during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Three independent and blinded graders provided technical skill scores using a validated assessment tool. Correlations between VR and live scores were assessed by Spearman's correlation coefficients (\u03c1). In addition, 117 historic RARP cases from participating surgeons were extracted, and the association between VR technical skill scores and urinary continence recovery were assessed by a multi-level mixed-effects model. Results A total of 20 (6 training and 14 expert) surgeons participated. Statistically significant correlations for scores provided between VR simulation and live surgery were found for overall and needle driving scores (\u03c1 = 0.555, p = 0.011; \u03c1 = 0.570, p = 0.009, respectively). A sub-analysis performed on training surgeons found significant correlations for overall scores between VR simulation and live surgery (\u03c1 = 0.828, p = 0.042). Expert cases with high VR needle driving scores had significantly greater continence recovery rates at 24 months following RARP (98.5% vs. 84.9%, p = 0.028). Conclusions Our study found significant correlations in technical scores between VR and live surgery, especially amongst training surgeons. Additionally, we found that VR needle driving scores were associated with continence recovery following RARP. Our data support the association of skills assessments between VR simulation and live surgery and potential implications for clinical outcomes.","authors":"Daniel I. Sanford, Runzhuo Ma, A.

Traditionally, it is performed through a laparotomy and a thoracotomy, and is associated with high rates of postoperative complications and mortality. The advent of robotic surgery has represented a technological evolution in the field of esophageal cancer treatment. Robot-assisted Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy (RAMIE) has been progressively widely adopted following the first reports on the safety and feasibility of this procedure in 2004. The robotic approach has better short-term postoperative outcomes than open esophagectomy, without jeopardizing oncologic radicality. The results of the comparison between RAMIE and conventional minimally invasive esophagectomy are less conclusive. This article will focus on the role of RAMIE in the current clinical scenario with particular attention to its possible benefits and perspectives.","authors":"F. Rebecchi, E. Ugliono, M. Allaix, M.

Although clinical series of adult robotic ureteral reconstruction appear in the literature, these reports tend to be limited in size and scope. We present the largest series to date of patients undergoing surgery for any obstruction distal to the UPJ along with outcomes and short-term follow up.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nA retrospective chart review was performed for patients undergoing robotic ureteral reconstructive procedures for any indication at our institution. Patients undergoing pyeloplasty, planned open procedures, and pediatric patients were excluded from the current analysis. Patient demographic data, etiology, procedure performed, and perioperative outcomes were reviewed. Postoperative follow up, imaging, and any re-interventions were also captured. The procedures performed included ureteroneocystostomy, psoas hitch, Boari flap, ureteroureterostomy, ureterolysis, ureterolithotomy, and nephropexy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 55 patients underwent robotic ureteral reconstructive procedures distal to the UPJ. Of these patients, 45 underwent intervention for a benign etiology and 10 for upper tract malignancy. All cases were successfully completed robotically with no open conversions and no intraoperative complications. Concurrent endoscopy was performed in 31 patients. The median operating room time was 221 minutes overall. Median blood loss was 50\u2009ml with no intraoperative transfusions. The average hospital stay was 1.6 days, with 39 patients (71%) discharged on postoperative day 1. All surgical margins were negative for malignancy. The median follow up with imaging was 181 days. There were two serious complications (3.6%) and three failures (5.3%).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRobotic reconstruction of the ureter distal to the UPJ is feasible, safe, effective, and able to replicate techniques of open surgery with equivalent outcomes to large robotic pyeloplasty and smaller distal ureteral reconstruction series.","authors":"Gordon Fifer, M.

Many factors play an essential role in hip stability and long-term outcomes. Surgical positioning remains fundamental for obtaining accurate implant fit and prevent hip dislocation or impingement.

The hypothesis was that robotic TKA would allow for more accurate leg alignment and component placement, and thus enhance clinical and radiological results and long-term survival rates. Methods A total of 113 primary TKAs performed using a cruciate-retaining implant in 102 patients from 2004 to 2007 were reviewed retrospectively. Of the 113 TKAs, 71 were robotic TKAs and 42 were conventional TKAs. Clinical outcomes (visual analogue scale pain score, Hospital for Special Surgery score, Western Ontario and McMaster University score, range of motion, and complications), radiological outcomes, and long-term survival rates were evaluated at a mean follow-up of 10 years. Results Clinical outcomes and long-term survival rates were similar between the two groups. Regarding the radiological outcomes, the robotic TKA group had significantly fewer postoperative leg alignment outliers (femoral coronal inclination, tibial coronal inclination, femoral sagittal inclination, tibial sagittal inclination, and mechanical axis) and fewer radiolucent lines than the conventional TKA group. Conclusions Both robotic and conventional TKAs resulted in good clinical outcomes and postoperative leg alignments.

The goal of this article is to review the available evidence for computerized navigation and robotics as an accuracy improvement tool for spinal deformity surgery, as well as to consider potential complications, impact on clinical outcomes, radiation exposure, and costs. Pedicle screw and rod construct are widely utilized for posterior spinal fixation in spinal deformity correction. Freehand placement of pedicle screws has long been utilized, although there is variable potential for inaccuracy depending on surgeon skill and experience. Malpositioned pedicle screws may have significant clinical implications ranging from nerve root irritation, inadequate fixation, CSF leak, perforation of the great vessels, or spinal cord damage. Computer-based navigation and robotics systems were developed to improve pedicle screw insertion accuracy and consistency, and decrease the risk of malpositioned pedicle fixation. The available evidence suggests that computer-based navigation and robotic-assisted guidance systems for pedicle cannulation are at least equivalent, and in several reports superior, to freehand techniques in terms of accuracy. CT and robotic navigation systems do appear to decrease radiation exposure to the operative team in some reports. Published reports do indicate longer operative times with use of robotic navigation compared with traditional freehand techniques for pedicle screw placement. To date, there is no conclusive evidence that use of CT or robotic navigation has any measurable impact on patient outcomes or overall complication reduction. There are theoretical advantages with robotic and CT navigation in terms of both speed and accuracy for severe spinal deformity or complex revision cases, however, there is a need for studies to investigate this technology in these specific cases. There is no evidence to date demonstrating the cost effectiveness of CT or robotic navigation as compared with traditional pedicle cannulation techniques. The review of available evidence suggests that computer-based navigation and robotic-assisted guidance systems for pedicle cannulation are at least equivalent, and in several reports superior, to freehand techniques in terms of radiographic accuracy. There is no current clinical evidence that the use of navigation or robotic techniques leads to improved patient outcomes or decreased overall complications or reoperation rates, and the use of these systems may substantially increase surgical costs.

Background: Current evidence for RAMIE originates from single-center studies, which may not be generalizable to the international multicenter experience. Methods: Twenty centers from Europe, Asia, North-America, and South-America participated from 2016 to 2019. Main endpoints included the surgical techniques, clinical outcomes, and early oncological results of ramie. Results: A total of 856 patients undergoing transthoracic RAMIE were included. Robotic surgery was applied for both the thoracic and abdominal phase (45%), only the thoracic phase (49%), or only the abdominal phase (6%). In most cases, the mediastinal lymphadenectomy included the low paraesophageal nodes (n=815, 95%), subcarinal nodes (n = 774, 90%), and paratracheal nodes (n = 537, 63%).

Circular stapled (52%), hand-sewn (30%), and linear stapled (18%) anastomotic techniques were used. In Ivor Lewis RAMIE, robot-assisted hand-sewing showed the highest anastomotic leakage rate (33%), while lower rates were observed with circular stapling (17%) and linear stapling (15%). In McKeown RAMIE, a hand-sewn anastomotic technique showed the highest leakage rate (27%), followed by linear stapling (18%) and circular stapling (6%).

The advent of stereotaxis, intra-operative navigation, endoscopy, and percutaneous instrumentation have altered the landscape of spine surgery. The concept of minimally invasive spine (MIS) surgery has blossomed over the past ten years and now robot-assisted spine surgery is being championed by some as another potential paradigm altering technological advancement. The application of robotics in other surgical specialties has been shown to be a safe and feasible alternative to the traditional, open approach. In 2004 the Mazor Spine Assist robot was approved by FDA to assist with placement of pedicle screws and since then, more advanced robots with promising clinical outcomes have been introduced. Currently, robotic platforms are limited to pedicle screw placement. However, there are centers investigating the role of robotics in decompression, dural closure, and pre-planned osteotomies. Robot-assisted spine surgery has been shown to increase the accuracy of pedicle screw placement and decrease radiation exposure to surgeons. However, modern robotic technology also has certain disadvantages including a high introductory cost, steep learning curve, and inherent technological glitches. Currently, robotic spine surgery is in its infancy and most of the objective evidence available regarding its benefits draws from the use of robots in a shared-control model to assist with the placement of pedicle screws. As artificial intelligence software and feedback sensor design become more sophisticated, robots could facilitate other, more complex surgical tasks such as bony decompression or dural closure. The accuracy and precision afforded by the current robots available for use in spinal surgery potentially allow for even less tissue destructive and more meticulous MIS surgery. This article aims to provide a contemporary review of the use of robotics in MIS surgery.","authors":"Blake N. Staub, S.

The oncological safety of ISR has been frequently discussed, especially relatively to abdominoperineal resection. This review critically discusses the oncological safety of ISR by evaluating the anatomical characteristics of the deep pelvis, the clinical indications, the role of distal and circumferential resection margins, the role of the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, the outcomes between surgical approaches (open, laparoscopic, and robotic), the comparison with abdominoperineal resection, the risk factors for oncological outcomes and local recurrence, the patterns of local recurrences after ISR, considerations on functional outcomes after ISR, and learning curve and surgical education on ISR. Abstract The surgical management of low-lying rectal cancer, within 5 cm from the anal verge (AV), is challenging due to the possibility, or not, to preserve the anus with its sphincter muscles maintaining oncological safety. The standardization of total mesorectal excision, the adoption of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, the implementation of rectal magnetic resonance imaging, and the evolution of mechanical staplers have increased the rate of anus-preserving surgeries. Moreover, extensive anatomy and physiology studies have increased the understanding of the complexity of the deep pelvis. Intersphincteric resection (ISR) was introduced nearly three decades ago as the ultimate anus-preserving surgery. The definition and indication of ISR have changed over time. The adoption of the robotic platform provides excellent perioperative results with no differences in oncological outcomes. Pushing the boundaries of anus-preserving surgeries has risen doubts on oncological safety in order to preserve function. This review critically discusses the oncological safety of ISR by evaluating the anatomical characteristics of the deep pelvis, the clinical indications, the role of distal and circumferential resection margins, the role of the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, the outcomes between surgical approaches (open, laparoscopic, and robotic), the comparison with abdominoperineal resection, the risk factors for oncological outcomes and local recurrence, the patterns of local recurrences after ISR, considerations on functional outcomes after ISR, and learning curve and surgical education on ISR.","authors":"G.

This study\u2019s main objective was to compare short-term complication rates, oncological outcomes, and the inflammatory stress response after colorectal resection for cancer performed laparoscopic or robot-assisted. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study comparing the robot-assisted approach to laparoscopic surgery for elective malignant colorectal neoplasm. Certified colorectal and da Vinci \u00ae robotic surgeons performed resections at a Danish tertiary colorectal high volume center from May 2017 to March 2019. We analyzed the two surgical groups using uni- and multivariate regression analyses to detect differences in intra- and postoperative clinical outcomes and the inflammatory stress response. Results Two hundred and ninety-eight patients were enrolled in the study. Significant differences favoring robot-assisted surgery was demonstrated for; length of hospital stay (4 days, interquartile range (4, 5) versus 5 days, interquartile range (4\u20137), p < 0.001), and intraoperative blood loss (50 mL, interquartile range (20\u2013100) versus 100 mL, interquartile range (50\u2013150), p < 0.001) compared to laparoscopic surgery. The inflammatory stress response was significantly higher after laparoscopic compared to robot-assisted surgery reflected by an increase in C-reactive protein concentration (exponentiated coefficient = 1.23, 95% confidence interval (1.06\u20131.46), p\u00a0= 0.008). No differences between the two groups were found concerning mortality, microradical resection rate, conversion to open surgery, and surgical or medical short-term complication rates. Conclusion Robot-assisted surgery is feasible and can be safely implemented for colorectal resections. The robot-assisted approach, when compared to laparoscopic surgery, was associated with improved intra- and postoperative outcomes.

We reviewed our experiences with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) in patients with high-risk clinical features.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nClinical database review identified high-risk patients undergoing RARP by two high-volume robotic surgeons. D'Amico's criteria for high-risk prostate cancer were utilized: prostate-specific antigen \u2265 20 ng\/mL, clinical stage \u2265 T2c, or preoperative Gleason grade \u2265 8. About 148 patients were identified in the study group. Mean age at surgery was 60.9 years, and mean body mass index was 27.9. Mean estimated blood loss was 150 cc and the transfusion rate was 2.7%. Median hospital stay was 1 day and the rate of major complications (Clavien grade \u2265 3) was 3.4%.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBilateral nerve preservation was feasible in 28.4%, and the rate of positive surgical margins was 20.9%. Final pathology demonstrated extra-capsular disease in 54.1% of patients and 12.3% had lymph node involvement. At 2 years of follow-up, 21.3% of patients had experienced biochemical recurrence or had persistent disease after treatment. Continence was 91.2% (1 pad or less) and total impotence (inability to masturbate) was 48.3%.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRARP does not compromise oncologic or functional outcomes in patients with high-risk prostate cancer. Although long-term study is necessary to validate oncologic and functional outcomes, our data suggest that the presence of high-risk disease is not a contraindication to a minimally invasive approach for radical prostatectomy at experienced centers.","authors":"G.

Robotic stereotactic assistance (ROSA\u00ae) for neurosurgery has been infrequently reported in the pediatric population. The goal of this case series was to describe the clinical experience, anesthetic and operative management, and treatment outcomes for pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy undergoing ROSA\u00ae neurosurgery at a single-center institution. Patients who underwent implantation of stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) leads for intractable epilepsy with ROSA\u00ae were retrospectively evaluated between August 2016 and June 2018. Demographics, perioperative management details, complications, and preliminary seizure outcomes after resective or ablative surgery were reviewed. Nineteen children who underwent 23 ROSA\u00ae procedures for SEEG implantation were included in the study. Mean operative time was 148 min. Eleven patients had subsequent resective or ablative surgery, and ROSA\u00ae was used to assist with laser probe insertion in five patients for seizure foci ablation. In total, 148 SEEG electrodes were placed without any perioperative complications. ROSA\u00ae is minimally invasive, provides superior accuracy for electrode placement, and requires less time than traditional surgical approaches for brain mapping. This emerging technology may improve the perioperative outcomes for pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy since large craniotomies are avoided; however, long-term follow-up studies are needed.","authors":"J.

The use of RAS in gynecologic patients includes hysterectomy, myomectomy, tubal reanastomoses, radical hysterectomy, lymph node dissection, and sacrocolpopexies. Although individual studies vary, gynecological RAS is often associated with longer operating room time but similar clinical outcomes, decreased blood loss, and shorter hospital stay. RAS procedures on women have, however, their own limitations: the patented equipment is very large, bulky, and expensive, the staff must be trained specifically on draping and docking the instruments, the lack of surgical haptic feedback, a limited vaginal access, a limited specific instrumentation, and the need for larger port incisions requiring fascial closure. The RAS significantly facilitates gynecologic surgery, even if well-designed, prospective studies are needed to fully assess the value of this equipments in particular studies with well-defined clinical and long-term outcomes, including complications, cost, pain, return to normal activity, and quality of life. The future of robotic surgery in gynecology may be bright, but currently, caution is advisable and clinically meaningful long-term outcomes are needed. These recent patents, however, has exciting potential for future applications, especially in long-distance telesurgery and might change the paradigm of gynecologic surgery in the future.","authors":"A.

Objective: To assess the use of intraoperative computed tomography (CT) image-guided navigation (IGN) and robotic assistance in posterior lumbar surgery and their relationship with patient radiation exposure and perioperative outcomes. Methods: Patients \u226518 years old undergoing 1- to 2-level transforaminal lateral interbody fusion in 12-month period were included. Chart review was performed for pre- and intraoperative data on radiation dose and perioperative outcomes. All radiation doses are quantified in milliGrays (mGy). Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were utilized for categorical variables. One-way analysis of variance with post hoc Tukey test was used for continuous variables. Results: A total of 165 patients were assessed: 12 IGN, 62 robotic, 56 open, 35 fluoroscopically guided minimally invasive surgery (MIS). There was a lower proportion of women in open and MIS groups (P = .010). There were more younger patients in the MIS group (P < .001). MIS group had the lowest mean posterior levels fused (P = .015). Total-procedure radiation, total-procedure radiation\/level fused, and intraoperative radiation was the lowest in the open group and highest in the MIS group compared with IGN and robotic groups (all P < .001). Higher proportion of robotic and lower proportion of MIS patients had preoperative CT (P < .001). Estimated blood loss (P = .002) and hospital length of stay (P = .039) were lowest in the MIS group. Highest operative time was observed for IGN patients (P < .001). No differences were observed in body mass index, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and postoperative complications (P = .313, .051, and .644, respectively). Conclusion: IGN and robotic assistance in posterior lumbar fusion were associated with higher intraoperative and total-procedure radiation exposure than open cases without IGN\/robotics, but significantly less than MIS without IGN\/robotics, without differences in perioperative outcomes. Fluoro-MIS procedures reported highest radiation exposure to patient, and of equal concern is that the proportion of total radiation dose also applied to the surgeon and operating room staff in fluoro-MIS group is higher than in IGN\/robotics and open groups.","authors":"Erik Wang, Jordan H.

There are no studies directly comparing outcomes of TRRYGB with different LRYGB techniques.MethodsOutcomes of 578 obese patients who underwent RYGB between 2011 and 2014 at an academic center were assessed. Multivariable analysis and propensity matching were used for comparing TRRYGB to different LRYGB techniques, including 21-mm EEA circular-stapled gastrojejunal anastomosis (GJA, LRYGB-21CS), linear-stapled GJA (LRYGB-LS), and hand-sewn GJA (LRYGB-HS).ResultsThe TRRYGB technique required a longer mean operative time compared to the other groups, respectively 204\u2009\u00b1\u200946 vs. 139\u2009\u00b1\u200930\u00a0min (LRYGB-21CS), 206\u2009\u00b1\u200937 vs. 158\u2009\u00b1\u200930\u00a0min (LRYGB-LS), and 210\u2009\u00b1\u200936 vs. 167\u2009\u00b1\u200930\u00a0min (LRYGB-HS). TRRYGB experienced a lower stricture rate (2 vs. 17%, P\u2009=\u20090.003), shorter hospital stay (2.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2 vs. 4.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.5\u00a0days, P\u2009=\u20090.008), and lower readmission rate (12 vs. 28%, P\u2009=\u20090.009). No significant differences in outcomes were observed when comparing RRYGB to LRYGB-LS or LRYGB-HS.ConclusionsTRRYGB increases operative time compared to all LRYGB techniques. TRRYGB was superior to LRYGB-21CS in terms of significantly shorter hospital stay, lower readmission rate, and less frequent GJA stricture formation. TRRYGB provides no clinical advantages over the LRYGB-LS and LRYGB-HS techniques.","authors":"T. Rogula, M. Koprivanac, M. Janik, Jacob A. Petrosky, A. Nowacki, Agnieszka Dombrowska, M. Kroh, S.

In addition, randomized trials have shown that addition of adjuvant radiotherapy following surgery improves loco-regional disease control among stage I intermediate-risk endometrial cancer patients. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of combined treatment of robotic surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy in this patient population. Methods A single-center retrospective study was conducted on stage I endometrioid-type endometrial cancer patients with intermediate-risk features (<50% myometrial involvement and grade 2\u20133 histopathology, or >50% myometrial involvement and grade 1\u20132 histopathology) treated with hysterectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy between January 2010 and December 2015. Data on surgery and radiotherapy were collected and correlated with clinical and surgical outcomes using log-rank. Oncologic outcomes were then compared between robotic surgery and laparotomy. Results A total of 179 intermediate-risk endometrial cancer patients were identified, of whom 135 (75.4%) received adjuvant radiotherapy and were included in the final analysis. Median age at diagnosis was 63 years (range 40\u201389) and median follow-up was 4.7 years (range 1.1\u20138.8). Seventy-seven patients (57%) underwent robotic surgery and 58 patients (43%) underwent laparotomy. Surgical staging with lymph node dissection was performed on 79.3% of the patients. The majority of patients (79.3%) received vaginal brachytherapy as part of adjuvant radiotherapy, while 20.7% received external-beam radiotherapy. Among the entire cohort, eight (5.9%) patients recurred and all eight recurrences occurred in the robotic surgery group; no recurrence was found in the laparotomy group. This translated into 5\u2009year disease-free survival of 100% in the laparotomy group, compared with 91.8% in the robotic surgery group (p=0.005). No difference in overall survival was found between the two groups (p=0.51). Conclusion Oncologic outcomes for stage I intermediate-risk endometrial cancer treated with hysterectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy at our institution are comparable to the previously published literature. The higher recurrence rate observed with robotic surgery at our institution has not been observed previously and requires further investigation.","authors":"Jiheon Song, T. Le, L. Hopkins, M.

Our aim was to collect and analyze outcomes related to anastomoses performed using a robotic approach and compare them with those done using laparoscopic or open approaches through meta-analysis. Methods A systematic review was conducted for articles comparing robotic with laparoscopic and\/or open operations (colectomy, low anterior resection, gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), pancreaticoduodenectomy, radical cystectomy, pyeloplasty, radical prostatectomy, renal transplant) published up to June 2019 searching Medline, Scopus, Google Scholar, Clinical Trials and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Studies containing information about outcomes related to hand-sewn anastomoses were included for meta-analysis. Studies with stapled anastomoses or without relevant information about the anastomotic technique were excluded. We also excluded studies in which the anastomoses were performed extracorporeally in laparoscopic or robotic operations. Results We included 83 studies referring to the aforementioned operations (4 randomized controlled and 79 non-randomized, 10 prospective and 69 retrospective) apart from colectomy and low anterior resection. Anastomoses done using robotic instruments provided similar results to those done using laparoscopic or open approach in regards to anastomotic leak or stricture. However, there were lower rates of stenosis in robotic than in laparoscopic RYGB (p=0.01) and in robotic than in open radical prostatectomy (p<0.00001). Moreover, all anastomoses needed more time to be performed using the robotic rather than the open approach in renal transplant (p\u22640.001).

Especially in the anatomical areas in the chest that are more difficult to reach in open surgery (including the superior mediastinum). The dexterity of the robotic instruments aid in performing a more extensive nodal dissection and the precision and detailed vision of the robotic system potentially improves staging, oncological outcomes and reduces complications (i.e., recurrent nerve palsy). In this article, we describe our experience and clinical outcomes in patients treated by robot assisted minimal invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE) in cN+ esophageal cancer patients with positive nodes localized in the superior mediastinum.\n\n\nMethods\nFrom May 2007-2018, all patients who had involved nodes by either fluor-18-deoxyglucose positron-emission-tomography-computed tomography (FDG-PET-CT) or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) + fine needle aspiration (FNA) localized in the superior mediastinum (above level Th4\/sternal angle) were identified. Patient characteristics, perioperative data, postoperative clinical outcomes\/complications and overall survival were prospectively recorded and retrospectively evaluated.\n\n\nResults\nForty patients (48% adenocarcinoma) met our inclusion criteria. All patients underwent a three-stage procedure with cervical anastomosis and 90% of the patients underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Mortality occurred in three patients (7.5%), of which two were caused by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The most frequent complications were pneumonia (25%), chylothorax (20%), anastomotic leakage (17.5%) and vocal cord paralysis (17.5%) which was grade 1 in 72% of the patients. Radicality rate (R0 resection) was 98% and the average lymph node yield was 24 (range, 9-57). Median overall and disease-free survival was 26 and 17 months, respectively.\n\n\nConclusions\nRAMIE for esophageal cancer patients with node positive disease in the superior mediastinum is associated with increased mortality\/morbidity.

Intraoperative outcomes of estimated blood loss and operative time, as well as postoperative outcomes of catheter and stent duration, length of hospital stay, inpatient nurse-controlled opioid use, patient-controlled analgesia and outpatient opioid prescription, complications, readmission, radiologic and clinical stricture recurrence, and follow-up were compared. Among the open cohort, indications for an open approach were evaluated, identifying patients with prior complex open abdominal surgery that would make an open approach preferable.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOpen ureteroneocystostomy was performed in 27 patients compared to 18 who underwent a robotic approach. The open and robotic cohorts were not significantly different in age, gender, Charlson Comorbidity Index, stricture location or side, abdominal surgery (laparoscopic or open), pelvic radiation or preoperative UTI. The robotic group had a significantly lower rate of prior open abdominal surgery. The robotic cohort had significantly lower EBL, LOS, catheter duration, prescribed morphine milliequivalents at discharge, and rate of PCA usage. Among the open cohort, 13 (48%) patients demonstrated indications making an open approach preferable. Comparing the robotic group to the remaining 14 open patients revealed significantly lower rate of inpatient PCA use, prescribed MME at discharge, LOS, and catheter duration. Mean operative time was higher in the robotic group. EBL was not significantly different in this sub-analysis.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRobotic ureteroneocystostomy provides similar outcomes when compared to an open approach in well-selected patients when assessing for recurrent ureteral obstruction or adverse events. Robotic surgery is associated with lower postoperative narcotic pain prescriptions at discharge, lower PCA usage and shorter length of stay which are important benefits when compared to open surgery.","authors":"P.

Variation in surgical care1\u20134 and decision-making5 is common. The chances of undergoing surgery may depend as much on where a person lives as on clinical circumstances1,6,7. Some patient choices drive variation (for example by seeking \u2018exceptional care\u2019, or the belief thereof) as happens with robotic surgery8, despite lack of documented benefits and even risk of harm9. These circumstances will arise more as patient preferences are expressed and heard (appropriately) in shared decision-making. Meanwhile opponents to standardization consider it diametrically opposed to individualized or patient-centred care10 and a one-size-fits-all, narrow-minded exclusionary attitude. Variation in surgical procedures is not a bad thing but patient outcomes may be unacceptably heterogeneous, especially when delivered beyond the intended use. Unwanted procedures or techniques with inferior outcomes11 drive up healthcare costs12, but cessation may be challenging. As reported in \u2018choosing wisely\u2019 campaigns, standardization rarely involves stopping surgical procedures that may be display low value for healthcare systems. The recent moratorium on transanal total mesorectal excision in Norway demonstrates the need to step back and re-evaluate a procedure based on detrimental outcomes13,14. Refinement of patient selection, standardized training, and supervision with evaluation of appropriate outcomes to expected standards are key. This highlights the need for standardization, audit and mature reflection when introducing a new intervention15. Clearly the multicontextual nature of healthcare does not facilitate standardization in every circumstance because patients display biological, psychological, social and cultural diversity. In addition, healthcare professionals have considerably diverse views and perspectives \u2013 perhaps defined by the apprenticeship model of training where vertically transmitted approaches to care are ingrained \u2013 such that geographical heterogeneity is common. A good example is the approach to managing lateral pelvic sidewall lymph nodes in patients with rectal cancer, where there has been an historical East\u2013West divide. These experiences and tacit knowledge bases constitute \u2018mindlines\u2019 as a result of decision maps created by learned behaviour rather than being evidence-based in favour of one or other option. Variation in treatment options is an integral component of individualized care, where several options \u2013 each with its inherent benefits and risks \u2013 may lead to a good outcome. The risk\u2013benefit is balanced by the surgeon\u2019s aim for the procedure (such as restoration of function or curative intent), the patient\u2019s expectations, and their collective willingness to compromise between risk, benefit and functional consequences. Decisions are sometimes based more on cultural context (for example, routine diverting stoma with an anterior resection) and risk experience (more likely to divert following a recent anastomotic leak) over the reality of clinical knowledge. Ultimately, the decision is best made by an informed patient with clinician involvement with visual aids or internet-based exploration (if needed) at the point of care. Validated comparisons of the different available treatment options, where feasible, should be the goal of standardized care. It is not surprising that agreeing on what standardization means specifically is challenging. The WHO has defined it as \u2018the process of developing, agreeing upon and implementing uniform technical specifications, criteria, methods, processes, designs or practices that can increase compatibility, interoperability, safety, repeatability and quality\u201916. Standardization can be implemented at several levels in healthcare (Table 1), with some examples published recently17,18. Some types of standard may be widespread, whereas others (typically relating to devices) vary considerably and seem to depend on individual surgeon preference19. In theory, most care plans could be standardized within a given institution as standard operating protocols (or procedures), but with some flexibility to encapsulate aberrant disease presentation or variable patient\/clinician choices. It is probable that new technologies, smartphones and apps will improve protocol-driven healthcare delivery including perioperative care20.

Methods: Between January 2003 and May 2005, 143 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer underwent a robotic radical prostatectomy. Prospective data collection included patient age, body mass index (BMI), clinical T stage, biopsy Gleason score, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Operative outcome measures included operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), and complications. Postoperative outcomes were length of hospital stay, catheter duration, pathology, margin status, biochemical recurrence, and return of continence. Results: Mean operative time was 241 minutes with an EBL of 274 mL. Five patients (3%) required conversion to open surgery. The average hospitalization was 1.8 days, and Foley catheters were removed after 8.9 days. Twenty-four of 141 men (17%) had a positive surgical margin, with a decrease from 23% in the first half of our experience to 11% in the latter half. Patients with an extracapsular extension had a significantly higher positive surgical margin rate than did those with organ-confined disease (47% vs 15%). Over 40% of the positive margins were located posteriorly. At a mean follow-up of 11 months, 96% of patients had a PSA<0.2 ng\/mL. The median time to complete continence was 3.5 months, and over 95% of patients were fully continent at 1 year. Conclusion: Robotic radical prostatectomy is an effective treatment modality for clinically localized prostate cancer. Although a learning curve needs to be overcome, patients experienced benefits in convalescence with early oncologic and functional outcomes comparable to those of the open approach.

As a result, much research is presently focused on finding an ideal donor site that results in good clinical outcomes while avoiding iatrogenic lymphedema of the donor area. \n \nThe omental flap with its lymph nodes based on the right gastroepiploic vessels that has been described for the treatment of lymphedema in the extremities avoids donor site lymphedema of the extremities. Harvesting this flap laparoscopically further reduces the donor site morbidity [1,2]. \n \nRobotic surgery has gained popularity in numerous surgical specialties, including plastic surgery [3,4], due to its advantages over laparoscopic and endoscopic techniques. Herein, we report a novel application of robotic surgery for the harvest of a right gastroepiploic lymph node flap (RGE-LNF) for the treatment of lymphedema of the extremities. To the best of our knowledge, the application of a robotic technique for the harvest of this flap has not been reported in the literature. \n \nA 55-year-old woman presenting with left lower extremity lymphedema and unsatisfactory outcomes following conservative treatment was offered surgical management with RGE-LNF transfer. All aspects of the various options for flap harvest were explained to her, including the open, laparoscopic, and robot-assisted techniques. The patient was comfortable with the robotic option and gave consent for the Da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) to be used for flap harvest (Supplemental Video S1, which demonstrates the robotic RGE- LNF harvest). \n \nAn experienced general surgeon trained in robotic surgery performed the harvest of the flap with guidance from the plastic surgery team. One 12-mm supraumbilical port was created with an optical trocar for camera placement. After abdomen insufflation, two 8-mm ports were inserted at least 8 cm laterally from and 5 cm below the supraumbilical port, one on the right and the other over the left lower abdomen. Finally, a 5-mm assistance port was inserted in the epigastric region slightly cephalad to the camera port and midway between the camera and the right-side port. The RGE-LNF is based on the right gastroepiploic artery and vein (Fig. 1). Exploration was started by identifying the omental attachment to the greater curvature of the stomach and transverse colon, followed by identification of the right gastroepiploic vessels. Flap dissection was initiated by detaching the omentum from the transverse colon. The vertical gastric branches at the cranial aspect of the flap were serially ligated while maintaining a flap width of approximately 5 cm. The craniocaudal dissection was completed, keeping the flap centered on the vascular pedicle. Dissection then proceeded to the left subcostal region where the left gastroepiploic vessels were ligated. Special attention was paid to include the lymph nodes, lymphatics, and the surrounding omental tissue during the flap harvest (Fig. 2). A flap with a length of 10 cm was dissected up to the origin of the right gastroepiploic vessels, remaining parallel to the greater curvature of the stomach. Finally, the right gastroepiploic artery and vein were carefully dissected, isolated, and ligated. The total time of flap harvest was 55 minutes. The flap was then exteriorized and transferred to the lymphedematous recipient site (Fig. 3). Under the operating microscope, the flap was minimally trimmed at the margins, avoiding any damage to the lymphatic tissue witin the flap. Microsurgical anastomoses were performed at the ankle level using the medial plantar vessels in an end-to-end fashion after adequate vessel preparation (Fig. 4). The procedure was uneventful and the patient remained comfortable during the perioperative period. \n \n \n \nFig. 1 \n \nAnatomical landmarks of the right gastroepiploic lymph node flap. The flap is based on the right gastroepiploic vessels and includes the omental tissue and embedded lymph nodes between the gastric and colonic attachment of the omentum. \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 2 \n \nPhotograph of the surgical procedure. The robot-assisted apparatus provided three-dimensional visualization, improving the precision and the lowering risk of vascular pedicle injury. \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 3 \n \nThe right gastroepiploic lymph node flap on a side table prior to the commencement of microanastomosis. The lymph nodes are clearly visible within the flap tissue. \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 4 \n \nInset of the right gastroepiploic lymph node flap at the ankle level and microanastomosis with the medial plantar recepient vessels. \n \n \n \nThe use of robotic surgery technologies, such as the Da Vinci system, has increased in various fields, and the distinct advantages of robotic surgery have been widely reported in the literature [4]. Likewise, when comparing the robot-assisted technique with the laparoscopic approach for the RGE-LNF harvest, we noted that the robot-assisted intraperitoneal approach had specific advantages. The three-dimensional optics of the Da Vinci system allowed superior visualization of the anatomy. Accurate bloodless dissection was possible due to the extremely precise platform, tremor elimination, and significant motion scaling. This was particularly important since the RGE-LNF is small, and the robotic intervention allowed preservation of the lymph nodes and the fine lymphatic channels close to the vascular pedicle. In addition, it also aided in the artery and vein dissection before the final flap pedicle division. \n \nRobot-assisted harvest of the RGE-LNF is feasible and reproducible. It represents an alternative method for flap harvest and paves the way for use of this approach for harvesting other intra-abdominal organs and tissues for reconstructive surgery. This may prove useful for patients who desire the application of the latest technology and less invasive procedures in their treatment, with the possibility of improved outcomes. It offers technical advantages over endoscopic harvesting and provides better cosmesis when compared to the open surgical technique. \n \nSome factors may limit the use of robotic interventions, such as increased cost, a steep learning curve, and increased operating time. However, the distinct advantages of this innovative surgical approach, such as tremor elimination, motion scaling, high-resolution three-dimensional optics, and superior ergonomics, make a compelling case for the expansion of its application in problem-solving specialties, including plastic and reconstructive surgery.","authors":"P.

Robotic surgery has been introduced in order to minimize such technical errors. The aim of the present paper was to evaluate clinical and surgical outcomes after a 3 years\u2019 experience of robotic assisted UKA with the Mako Robotic Arm. Methods: Seventy-three patients undergoing UKA with robotic instrumentation (65 medial UKAs, 8 lateral UKAs) and with a clinical follow-up of 3 -37 months were included in the present study. A complete clinical evaluation with KOOS, FJS-12 and SF-12 was administered to all patients pre and post operatively. Post-operative HKA angle and surgical time were also recorded. Results: Mean post-operative KOOS score was 81.32 (SD 17.19), while the mean FJS-12 score was 75.51 (SD 30.12) and the mean SF-12 Physical Score 42.25 (SD 9.97). 91% to 88% of post-operative results were considered satisfactory. Only 1 UKA failure was reported (1.3%) caused by peri-prosthetic infection. In medial UKAs mean postoperative HKA angle in extension was 3.9\u00b0 varus (SD 2.5\u00b0), with no case of overcorrection; in lateral UKAs mean postoperative HKA angle in extension was 1.9\u00b0 valgus (SD 1.9\u00b0) with 1 case (13%) of overcorrection.

Robotic surgery has been introduced in order to minimize such technical errors. The aim of the present paper was to evaluate clinical and surgical outcomes after a 3 years\u2019 experience of robotic assisted UKA with the Mako Robotic Arm. Methods: Seventy-three patients undergoing UKA with robotic instrumentation (65 medial UKAs, 8 lateral UKAs) and with a clinical follow-up of 3 -37 months were included in the present study. A complete clinical evaluation with KOOS, FJS-12 and SF-12 was administered to all patients pre and post operatively. Post-operative HKA angle and surgical time were also recorded. Results: Mean post-operative KOOS score was 81.32 (SD 17.19), while the mean FJS-12 score was 75.51 (SD 30.12) and the mean SF-12 Physical Score 42.25 (SD 9.97). 91% to 88% of post-operative results were considered satisfactory. Only 1 UKA failure was reported (1.3%) caused by peri-prosthetic infection. In medial UKAs mean postoperative HKA angle in extension was 3.9\u00b0 varus (SD 2.5\u00b0), with no case of overcorrection; in lateral UKAs mean postoperative HKA angle in extension was 1.9\u00b0 valgus (SD 1.9\u00b0) with 1 case (13%) of overcorrection. Mean skin to skin surgical time decreased from 83.2 minutes (SD 13.0) to 70.0 minutes (SD 10.9) along the learning curve.

It also describes our techniques for the feasibility of performing such hysterectomies by the minimally invasive way. Materials and Methods: A five-year retrospective chart review was performed at the Minimal Access and Robotic Surgery Unit of the Department of Gynecology at Apollo Hospital, Hyderabad. Demographic and pre-operative and post-operative data were recorded. Clinical assessment including bimanual examination and surgery was made by a single senior surgeon. Intra-operative conversions, complications and post-operative complications were recorded. Results: A total of 128 women were included in this study, 5 patients underwent robotic-assisted hysterectomy. The average age was 44.4, body mass index - was 27.6 and size of the uterus was 17.5 weeks. The most common diagnosis was leiomyoma. The median Operating room (OR) time was 107 min. There was a need for myomectomy in 39.8%, extensive adhesiolysis in 33.6% and dense bladder adhesion in 26.6%. The average drop in haemoglobin was 1.72 g%, and hospital stay was 2 days. The specimen was removed by vaginal morcellation (2 cases via an umbilical port). Conversion to open surgery was required in 10.9% of cases. The conversion was significantly correlated with excessive haemorrhage and bladder injury but not with difficult hysterectomy, difficult bladder dissection or adhesions. There were 3 cases of bladder injury detected and managed intraoperatively. Conclusion: Laparoscopic hysterectomy is technically feasible and safe procedure for large uteri. The learning curve is about 50 cases and can be performed by experienced surgeons regardless of the size, number or location of the myomas without much morbidity.","authors":"R. Sinha, G.

Minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS) for mitral valve repair or replacement (MVR\/r) has been performed successfully with incremental improvements in techniques over the past decade. These minimally invasive procedures, while attractive to patients and referring physicians, should meet the same high bar for optimal clinical outcomes and long-term durability of valve repair as traditional sternotomy procedures. The majority of MICS MVR\/r procedures are performed via a right minithoracotomy approach with direct or camera-assisted visualization, with a minority of centers performing robotic MVR\/r. Outcomes with MICS MVR\/r have been shown to have similar morbidity and mortality rates as traditional sternotomy MV procedures but with the advantage of reduced transfusions, postoperative atrial fibrillation, and time to recovery. More recently, transcatheter mitral valve repair and replacement (TMVR\/r) has become a reality. Percutaneous MV repair technology is currently FDA approved for patients with nonsurgical high-risk degenerative mitral regurgitation. Other TMVR\/r technology is at various levels of preclinical and clinical investigation, although these devices are proving to be more challenging compared to transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) due to the significantly more complex mitral anatomy and the greater heterogeneity of mitral disease requiring treatment. In this article, we review current techniques for MICS MVR\/r and upcoming catheter-based therapies for the mitral valve.","authors":"Basel Ramlawi, J.

Fifty-four patients with T1-category BOT carcinoma (50 [92.6%] p16-positive) were treated with definitive intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), including 34 (63%) who received concurrent chemotherapy. Sixty-one patients with CUP site (38 [62.3%] p16-positive) received definitive (42 [68.9%]) or postoperative (19 [31.1%]) IMRT, including 22 (36%) who received concurrent chemotherapy.\n\n\nInterventions\nDefinitive or postoperative IMRT, with or without concurrent chemotherapy.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nCharacteristics of mucosal clinical target volume (CTV-T), nodal CTV, and organ-at-risk dosimetry; local, regional, and distant control; cause-specific and overall survival; and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 3 or higher late toxic effects.\n\n\nResults\nOf 115 participants, 104 (90.4%) were male; mean (SD) age was 59 (10) years. High-dose CTV-T was prescribed in all 54 patients with BOT carcinoma and 23 (37.7%) with CUP site (effect size [\u0394], 62%; 95% CI, 50%-74%). Low-dose CTV-T included mucosal pharyngeal sites outside the oropharynx in no patients with BOT carcinoma and 26 (42.6%) (95% CI, 30%-54%) with CUP site, with greater low-dose CTV-T volume in CUP site than BOT carcinoma (113 vs 84 cm3; \u0394, 30 cm3; 95% CI, 10-49 cm3). Bilateral neck irradiation was used in 53 of 54 patients (98.1%) with BOT carcinoma and 46 of 61 (75.4%) with CUP site (\u0394, 23%; 95% CI, 12% to 34%). Patients with BOT carcinoma received a higher maximum dose to the mandible (71 vs 67.2 Gy; \u0394, 3.8 Gy; 95% CI, 1.6 to 6 Gy), with a nonsignificantly higher maximum dose (66.1 vs 62.8 Gy; 3.2 Gy; 95% CI, -0.1 to 6.5 Gy) and lower mean dose to the larynx (43.8 vs 47.1 Gy; 3.3 Gy; 95% CI, -0.3 to 6.9 Gy). There were no significant differences in local control, regional control, distant control, cause-specific survival, and overall survival between the BOT carcinoma and CUP site groups stratified by p16 status. Grade 3 Radiation Therapy Oncology Group late toxic effects occurred in 2 patients (3.3%) with CUP site (both neck fibrosis) and 5 (9.3%) with BOT carcinoma (2 neck fibrosis, 2 osteoradionecrosis, and 1 dysphagia).\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nIntensity-modulated radiotherapy for CUP site or T1-category BOT carcinoma had similar clinical outcomes. Identifying hidden BOT primary carcinoma with novel approaches (eg, transoral robotic surgery and transoral laser microsurgery) may lead to changes in the radiotherapy target volume and dose prescription. Studies are needed to investigate the effect of these differences on quality of life and functional outcomes.","authors":"A. Hosni, Peter R. Dixon, A. Rishi, Michael Au, Wei Xu, Yuyao Song, D.

The most suitable surgical technique for patients with multiple vessel and organ variations as well as SIT remains unclear. Furthermore, there has been insufficient clinical evidence that demonstrates which surgical techniques achieve the best outcomes. Finally, the standard of care has not yet been determined. We present the case of a 60-year-old man with SIT, who was diagnosed with moderately and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma at the gastroesophageal junction. We further describe the advantage of using robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery in patients with this anomaly. Patient concerns: A 60-year-old man complained of pain in his upper abdomen for 3 months. Physical examination revealed an apex beat in the right fifth intercostal space, and vascular anomalies were noted on abdominal angiographic computed tomography. Diagnoses: Moderately and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma at the gastroesophageal junction with SIT. Interventions: Robot-assisted total gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection and hand-sewn Roux-en-Y anastomosis was performed. Outcomes: The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the seventh postoperative day. Lessons: Robotic surgery for gastric cancer is a safe and feasible alternative to laparoscopic surgery and it can be successfully used to treat gastric cancer in patients with SIT with multiple anatomic variations. As exemplified by our case, SIT might be accompanied by multiple anatomic variations. Detailed preoperative detailed imaging of the blood vessels and gastrointestinal tract is useful in these patients.","authors":"Yinghao Cao, Jiang Li, Liming Shen, Jiliang Wang, Z. Xia, K.

However, on long-term outcomes for patients with early-stage non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), whether the robotic procedure is superior to video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and thoracotomy is unclear. Nonetheless, in the article titled \u201cLong-term survival based on the surgical approach to lobectomy for clinical stage I non\u2013small cell lung cancer: comparison of robotic, video assisted thoracic surgery, and thoracotomy lobectomy\u201d by Yang et al. that was recently published in Annals of Surgery, the authors provided convincing evidence that the robotic procedure results in similar long-term survival as compared with VATS and thoracotomy. Minimally invasive procedures typically result in shorter lengths of hospital stay, and the robotic procedure in particular results in superior lymph node assessment.Main bodyOur propensity score-matched study generated high-quality data. Based on our findings, we see promise in expanding patient access to robotic lung resections. In this study, propensity score matching minimized the bias involved between groups. Nevertheless, due to its retrospective nature, bias may still exist. Currently, the concept of rapid rehabilitation is widely accepted, and it is very difficult to set up a randomized controlled trial to compare robotic, VATS, and thoracotomy procedures for the treatment of NSCLC. Therefore, to overcome this limitation and to minimize bias, the best approach is to use a registry and prospectively collected, propensity score-matched data.ConclusionsRobotic lung resections result in similar long-term survival as compared with VATS and thoracotomy. Robot-assisted and VATS procedures are associated with short lengths of hospital stay, and the robotic procedure in particular results in superior lymph node assessment. Considering the alarming increase in the incidence of lung cancer in China, a nationwide database of prospectively collected data available for clinical research would be especially important.","authors":"Hao-Xian Yang","year":2016,"url":"https:\/\/www.semanticscholar.org\/paper\/501b347f9daed5c87ff9dcf162d75da2fb4defa9"},{"title":"Artificial Intelligence in Andrology: From Semen Analysis to Image Diagnostics","abstract":"Artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine has gained a lot of momentum in the last decades and has been applied to various fields of medicine.

This review presents an evolution of robot-assisted surgical systems for knee replacement with an emphasis on the clinical results available in the literature. Ever since various robotic-assistance systems were developed and used clinically worldwide, studies have demonstrated that these systems are as safe as and more accurate than conventional methods of manual implantation. Robotic surgical assistance will likely result in improved surgical technique and improved clinical results.","authors":"N. Netravali, Feimo Shen, Young-Bae Park, W.

For all patients, the mean (SEM) skin-to-skin operative times were similar in both groups (163.2 [10.1] and 165.7 [9.5] minutes, respectively; P\u00a0=\u00a0.43). When the last 21 patients who underwent robotic posterior retroperitoneal adrenalectomy were compared with the 31 patients from the laparoscopic series, it was seen that the mean (SEM) operative time was shorter for the robotic group than for the laparoscopic group (139.1 [10.9] vs 166.9 [8.2] minutes; P\u00a0=\u00a0.046). The mean (SEM) estimated blood losses and hospital stays were similar between groups. The mean (SEM) pain score on postoperative day 1 was lower in the robotic group than in the laparoscopic group (2.5 [0.3] vs 4.2 [0.4]; P\u00a0=\u00a0.008); however, the mean (SEM) pain scores for the groups were similar on postoperative day 14 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.53). There were no deaths or cases of morbidity in either group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur study shows that, beyond the learning curve for experienced laparoscopic surgeons, robotic posterior retroperitoneal adrenalectomy shortens the skin-to-skin operative time compared with the laparoscopic approach. Our results also suggest that the immediate postoperative pain may be less severe for patients who undergo robotic posterior retroperitoneal adrenalectomy.","authors":"O. A\u011fcao\u011flu, S.

There is, however, a relative paucity of data related to robot-assisted ureteral reimplantation (RAUR) in adult patients for benign stricture disease. We sought to determine the periprocedure outcomes of open distal ureteral reimplantation vs RAUR at our institution.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nWe retrospectively identified 10 consecutive mid\/distal RAUR procedures performed by one surgeon since 2005. Twenty-four patients undergoing open mid\/distal ureter reconstruction over the same period were identified, and 10 controls matched for age and body mass index (BMI) were used for comparison. Demographic, operative, and clinical\/radiographic outcomes were compared.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEtiology of the strictures included stone disease (n=8, 40%), iatrogenic injury during previous abdominopelvic surgery (n=10, 50%), or other causes (n=2, 10%). None of the robotic procedures necessitated conversion to open surgery. No intraoperative complications occurred. Six neocystostomies, three psoas hitches, and one Boari flap were completed in an open fashion. Four neocystostomies, four psoas hitches, and two Boari flaps were performed in the RAUR group. Estimated blood loss (30.6 vs 327.5 mL, P=0.001) and length of hospital stay (2.4 vs 5.1 d, P=0.01) were significantly reduced in the robotic group. Median BMI (29.4\u00b15.3 vs 26.5\u00b15.2, P=0.130) and operative time in minutes (306.6 vs 270.0 min, P=0.316) were higher in the robotic group, although these were not statistically significant. None of the patients in either group had clinical or radiologic evidence of recurrent stricture disease at a median follow-up of 30 and 24 months in the open and RAUR groups, respectively. The retrospective comparative nature of this study may introduce selection bias.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn experienced hands, RAUR for mid\/distal benign ureteral strictures appears to be a reasonable alternative to open surgery.","authors":"S.

In an attempt to overcome this laparoscopic weakness and to facilitate the difficult steps in the minimally invasive surgery for choledochal cyst resection in children, we have performed the robot-assisted resection of the choledochal cyst. The aim of this study is to report lessons and tips obtained from our experience of the robot-assisted choledochal cyst resection in children.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nFrom July 2008 to October 2011, we have attempted robot-assisted resections of choledochal cyst for 14 children using the da Vinci Robotic Surgical System(\u00ae) (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA). We analyzed retrospectively reviewed medical records for patients' clinical characteristics, operative methods, and postoperative outcomes including operative time, hospital days, and complications.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn 3 early consecutive cases, we encountered serious technical problems and complications. However, after the operator underwent the robot system off-site training program, complete resection of the choledochal cyst and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy were performed successfully without difficulty and any complication in the 11 later consecutive cases. The important technical developments of our late-period operations include placing the patient's body above the operative table, performing the extracorporeal jejunojejunostomy through an umbilical incision, omitting the operative cholangiography with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography substitution, exposure of the porta hepatis by lateral retractions of the gallbladder and the falciform ligament with anchoring sutures to the abdominal wall, and using a third robotic arm for counter-traction of tissues for careful dissection.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWe believe that the techniques of pediatric robotic choledochal cyst resection have evolved from the previous experiences to be safer and easier.","authors":"Eun Young Chang, Young Ju Hong, H.

However, workflow, usability, interdisciplinary setups, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness have to be proven prospectively. This article includes a short description of robotic structures and workflow, followed by preliminary results of a randomized prospective study comparing conventional free-hand techniques with routine spine navigation and robotic-assisted procedures. Additionally, we present cases performed with a spinal robotic device, assessing not only the accuracy of the robotic-assisted procedure but also other factors (eg, minimal invasiveness, radiation dosage, and learning curves). Currently, the use of robotics in spinal surgery greatly enhances the application of minimally invasive procedures by increasing accuracy and reducing radiation exposure for patients and surgeons compared with standard procedures.

The learning curve (LC) for laparoscopic and robotic surgery can be steep. We aim to evaluate the effect of the initial LC on operative, postoperative, and pathologic outcomes of the first 60 RARC performed at our newly established robotics program.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nAfter obtaining Institutional Review Board approval, we reviewed the clinical and pathologic data from 60 consecutive patients with clinically localized bladder cancer who underwent RARC with PLND from January 2008 to March 2010. The patients were grouped into tertiles and assessed for effect of LC using analysis of variance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatient demographics and clinical characteristics were similar across tertiles. The mean total operative time trended down from the 1st to 3rd tertile from 525 minutes to 449 minutes, respectively (P=0.059). Mean estimated blood loss was unchanged across tertiles. Complications decreased as the LC progressed from 14 (70%) in the 1st tertile to 6 (30%) in each of the 2nd and 3rd tertiles (P<0.013). The mean total lymph node yield and number of positive margins were unchanged across tertiles.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRARC with PLND can be performed safely at a high-volume newly established robotic surgery program with an experienced team without compromising operative, postoperative, and short-term pathologic outcomes during the LC for surgeons who are experienced in ORC.","authors":"K.

A single center experience.","abstract":"BACKGROUND\nRobotic approach for rectal cancer competes with laparoscopy in centers dedicated to minimally invasive surgery (MIS) due to the technologic advantage. This is a report of our experience with MIS for rectal cancer.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA series of 84 consecutive patients with laparoscopic resection (between 1995-2010) and 38 consecutive patients with robotic resection (between 2008-2010) for primary rectal cancer were analyzed. Hartmann's procedures were excluded. Clinical and pathologic outcomes were reviewed retrospectively.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the laparoscopic group (LG), 50 anterior rectal resections (ARR), 34 abdominal perineal resections (APR) were performed while in the robotic group(RG) there were 30 ARR and 8 APR. The median operative time was 182 min (140-220 min) in LG and 208 min (180-300 min) in RG (p = 0.0002). No statistically significant difference was noticed between the groups in terms of conversion, morbidity, anastomotic leak and postoperative stay rates. Margin clearance was obtained in all patients and the median number of removed lymph nodes was similar: 11.37 in RG vs. 11.07 in the LG (p = 0.65) with a higher rate of metastatic lymph node involvement in laparoscopy (p = 0.0l012). Blood loss was higher in LG (150 ml vs. 100 ml; p = 0.0001).

Therefore, we need to update the treatment options and strategies so that patients can receive optimal and tailored treatment. The present review aimed to elucidate the recent global trends and update the surgical treatment strategies in colorectal cancer by citing the literature published in the last 2 years, namely 2016 and 2017. Although laparoscopic surgery is still considered the most common approach for the treatment of colorectal cancer, new surgical technologies such as transanal total mesorectal excision, robotic surgery, and laparoscopic lateral pelvic lymph node dissection are emerging. However, with the recent evidence, superiority of the laparoscopic approach to the open approach for rectal cancer seems to be controversial. Surgeons should notice the risk of adverse outcomes associated with unfounded and uncontrolled use of these novel techniques. Many promising results are accumulating in preoperative and postoperative treatment including chemotherapy, chemoradiotherapy, and targeted therapy. Development of new biomarkers seems to be essential for further improvement in the treatment outcomes of colorectal cancer patients.","authors":"T. Matsuda, K. Yamashita, H. Hasegawa, T.

To date, however, there have been few widespread applications of robotic technology in neurosurgery. The authors hypothesized that image-guided robotic placement of a ventriculostomy catheter is safe, highly accurate, and highly reproducible.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSixteen patients requiring catheter ventriculostomy for ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt or reservoir placement were included in this retrospective study. All patients underwent image-guided robotic placement of a ventricular catheter, using a preoperatively defined trajectory.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll catheters were placed successfully in a single pass. There were no catheter-related hemorrhages and no injuries to adjacent neural structures. The mean distance of the catheter tip from the target was 1.5 mm. The mean operative times were 112 minutes for VP shunt placement and 42.3 minutes for reservoir placement. The mean operative times decreased over the course of the study by 49% for VP shunts and by 19% for reservoir placement.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe robotic placement of a ventriculostomy catheter using a preplanned trajectory is safe, highly accurate, and highly reliable. This makes single-pass ventriculostomy possible in all patients, even in those with very small ventricles, and may permit catheter-based therapies in patients who would otherwise be deemed poor surgical candidates because of ventricle size. Robotic placement also permits careful preoperative study and optimization of the catheter trajectory, which may help minimize the risks to bridging veins and sulcal vessels.","authors":"S.

Many advances have been made in the diagnosis and management of rectal cancer. These include clinical staging with imaging studies such as endorectal ultrasound and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging, operative approaches such as transanal endoscopic microsurgery and laparoscopic and robotic assisted proctectomy, as well as refined neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies. For stage II and III rectal cancers, combined chemoradiotherapy offers the lowest rates of local and distant relapse, and is delivered neoadjuvantly to improve tolerability and optimize surgical outcomes, particularly when sphincter-sparing surgery is an endpoint. The goal in rectal cancer treatment is to optimize disease-free and overall survival while minimizing the risk of local recurrence and toxicity from both radiation and systemic therapy. Optimal patient outcomes depend on multidisciplinary involvement for tailored therapy. The successful management of rectal cancer requires a multidisciplinary approach, with the involvement of enterostomal nurses, gastroenterologists, medical and radiation oncologists, radiologists, pathologists and surgeons. The identification of patients who are candidates for combined modality treatment is particularly useful to optimize outcomes.

With the aid of robotic surgery, an excellent overview and reach of the thoracic inlet can be accomplished. In this way, patients with upper mediastinal esophageal cancer are eligible for esophageal resection with curative intent. The aim of this study was to review the results of a consecutive series of patients who underwent robot-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE) for tumors of the upper 1\/3 of the esophagus or positive lymph nodes in the upper mediastinum.\n\n\nMETHODS\nBetween 2007-2016, 31 patients who underwent RAMIE in the UMC Utrecht for proximal esophageal cancer or proximal thoracic lymphadenopathy were identified from a prospective surgical database. Perioperative characteristics and oncologic outcomes were collected.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe majority of patients had a squamous cell carcinoma. Clinical tumor stage was cT3 or higher in 25 (81%) of patients. Clinically positive lymph nodes (cN1-3) were observed in 29 (94%) patients. Neoadjuvant treatment was administered in 27 (87%) patients. Median duration of the surgical procedure was 435 min (range 299-874 min). Pulmonary complications were most frequent and occurred in 13 (42%) patients. Median intensive care (ICU stay) was 1 day (range 1-65 days) and median overall postoperative hospital stay was 15 days (range 10-118 days). In hospital mortality was 10%. Causes of mortality were tracheo-neo-esophageal fistula, sepsis after abdominal wall drainage due to leakage of the jejunal fistula resulting in respiratory and kidney failure, after which refraining further treatment resulting in death, and irreversible ARDS in a patient with COPD Gold III needing extracorporeal life support. Radical resection was achieved in 30 (97%) of the patients. Median number of retrieved lymph nodes was 22 (range 9-57). Median time of follow up was 18 months (range 3-81 months). Median disease-free survival was 13 months (range 0-81 months) and median overall survival was 16 months (range 0-81 months). Tumor recurrence occurred in 15 patients (48%) and was locoregional only in 3 patients, systemic only in 5 patients and combined locoregional and systemic in 7 patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRobot assisted thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy with curative intent in patients with upper mediastinal esophageal cancer is feasible, but associated with increased in hospital mortality.

Several studies have shown the superiority of LLR to open liver resection (OLR) in term of perioperative outcomes. With this review, we aim to systematically assess short-term and long-term major outcomes in patients who underwent LLR for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in order to illustrate the advantages of minimally invasive liver surgery. Through an advanced PubMed research, we selected all retrospective, prospective, and comparative clinical trials reporting short-term and long-term outcomes of any series of patients with diagnosis of HCC who underwent laparoscopic or robotic resection. Reviews, meta-analyses, or case reports were excluded. None of the patients included in this review has received a previous locoregional treatment for the same tumor nor has undergone a laparoscopic-assisted procedure. We considered morbidity and mortality for evaluation of major short-term outcomes, and overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for evaluation of long-term outcomes. A total of 1,501 patients from 17 retrospective studies were included, 15 studies compare LLR with OLR. Propensity-score matching (PSM) analysis was used in 11 studies (975 patients). The majority of the studies included patients with good liver function and a single HCC. Cirrhosis at pathology ranged from 33% to 100%. Overall mortality and morbidity ranges were 0-2.4% and 4.9-44% respectively, with most of the complications being Clavien-Dindo grade I or II (range: 3.9-23.3% vs. 0-9.52% for Clavien I-II and \u2265 III respectively). The median blood loss ranged from 150 to 389 mL; the range of the median duration of surgery was 134-343 minutes. The maximum rate of conversion was 18.2%. The median duration of hospitalization ranged from 4 to 13 days. The ranges of overall survival rates at 1-, 3- and 5-year were 72.8-100%, 60.7-93.5% and 38-89.7% respectively. The ranges of disease free survival rates at 1-, 3- and 5-year were 45.5-91.5%, 20-72.2% and 19-67.8% respectively. The benefits of LLR in term of complication rate, blood loss, and duration of hospital stay make this procedure an advantageous alternative to OLR, especially for cirrhotic patients in whom the use of LLR reduces the risk of post-hepatectomy liver failure. The limits of LLR can be overcome by robotic surgery, which could therefore be preferred. Further benefits of minimally invasive surgery derive from its ability to reduce the formation of adhesions in view of a salvage liver transplant. In conclusion, the results of this review seem to confirm the safety and feasibility of LLR for HCC as well as its superiority to OLR according to perioperative outcomes.","authors":"S. Di Sandro, M.

As new robotic systems become available, it will be important to identify the impact of emerging technology on clinical outcomes in robotic surgery.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA total of 140 laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) procedures have been performed with robotic assistance (80 with Zeus and 60 with da Vinci). Data were collected regarding the robotic operative tasks performed, the robotic setup time, the robotic operative time, and the total operative time for all cases.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe 60 patients who had a da Vinci LRYGB had a statistically lower body mass index, when compared to patients who underwent Zeus LRYGB (n = 80; P < 0.05). The groups were otherwise statistically similar. The set-up time required for the Zeus cases decreased quickly but increased significantly once the switch was made to da Vinci. The da Vinci set-up time then decreased significantly after the first 10 cases (P < 0.05). There was no demonstrable regression in the robotic operative time when the robotic system was changed to da Vinci. Total operative time temporarily increased during the first 10 da Vinci cases but then decreased significantly (P < 0.05). There were two intraoperative gastrojejunostomy (GJ) leaks in this series (one with each system). There were no anastomotic strictures at the robotic GJ or mortalities throughout this series.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur data suggest that the impact of robotic platform change should be minimal in an established program.

Furthermore, safety regulations prevent automatically driving robotic arms to this optimal positioning. We propose a Head-Mounted Display (HMD) based augmented reality (AR) guidance system for optimal surgical arm setup. In this case, the staff equipped with HMD aligns the robot with its planned virtual counterpart. The main challenge, however, is the perspective ambiguities hindering such collaborative robotic solution. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel registration concept for intuitive alignment of such AR content by providing a multi-view AR experience via reflective-AR displays that show the augmentations from multiple viewpoints. Using this system, operators can visualize different perspectives simultaneously while actively adjusting the pose to determine the registration transformation that most closely superimposes the virtual onto real. The experimental results demonstrate improvement in the interactive alignment of a virtual and real robot when using a reflective-AR display. We also present measurements from configuring a robotic manipulator in a simulated trocar placement surgery using the AR guidance methodology.","authors":"J. Fotouhi, M. Unberath, N. Navab, T.

TaTME has several clinical benefits over laparoscopic surgery, such as better exposure of the distal rectum and direct determination of distal resection margin. Although evidence demonstrating the true benefits of taTME over laparoscopic TME (LapTME) is still insufficient, accumulating data have revealed that, as compared with LapTME, taTME is associated with shorter operative time and a lower conversion rate without jeopardizing other short-term outcomes. However, taTME is a technically demanding procedure with specific complications such as urethral injury, and so sufficient experience of LapTME and step-by-step acquisition of the skills needed for this procedure are requisite. The role of transanal endoscopic surgery is expected to change, along with the recent progress in the treatment of rectal cancer, such as robotic surgery and the watch-and-wait strategy. Optimization of treatment will be needed in the future in terms not only of oncological but also of functional outcomes.","authors":"S. Hasegawa, Y. Yoshida, M. Morimoto, D. Kojima, A. Komono, N.

We aimed to evaluate whether gaining experience in robotic gastrectomy could improve surgical outcomes in the treatment of gastric cancer. Materials and Methods Two hundred and seven consecutive cases of patients with clinical stage I gastric cancer who underwent robotic surgery at the National Cancer Center of Korea between February 2009 and February 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Surgical outcomes were analyzed and compared between the initial 100 and later 100 cases. Results Seven patients required conversion to open surgery and were excluded from further analysis. The mean operating time for all patients was 248.8 minutes, and mean length of hospitalization was 8.0 days. Twenty patients developed postoperative complications. Thirteen were managed conservatively, while 6 had major complications requiring invasive procedures. One mortality occurred owing to myocardial infarction. Operating time was significantly shorter in the latter 100 cases than in the initial 100 cases (269.9 versus 233.5 minutes, P<0.001). The number of retrieved lymph nodes was significantly greater in the latter cases (35.9 versus 39.9, P=0.032). The hospital stay of patients with complications was significantly longer in the initial cases than in the latter cases (16 versus 7 days, P=0.005). Conclusions Increased experience with the robotic procedure for gastric cancer was associated with improved outcomes, especially in operating time, lymph node retrieval, and shortened hospital stay of complicated patients. Further development of surgical techniques and technology might enhance the role of robotic surgery for gastric cancer.","authors":"J. Y. Park, Young-Woo Kim, K. Ryu, B. Eom, H. Yoon, D.

Extensive research has hinted at the potential of robotics to improve different aspects of surgery (eg, higher precision and associated favorable clinical outcomes). In addition to technical advances in surgery, there is also progress regarding knee implant design, for example, implants designed to obviate the need for sacrificing cruciate ligaments of the knee during surgery, which is believed to lead to preferable functional outcomes and more natural knee motion. Robotic assistance is considered valuable in this instance, owing to higher levels of accuracy and more accurate implant alignment. In this article, we summarize advantages and issues associated with robot-assisted surgery. We briefly discuss less-invasive, ligament-retaining surgery and alternatives to traditional total knee arthroplasty. We present preliminary data regarding patient-reported outcomes from total knee arthroplasty and a less-invasive alternative treatment. We also present the specific surgical technique used in our clinic (bi-unicompartmental knee arthroplasty), which combines the advantages of modern tissue-sparing multicompartmental knee arthroplasty and robot-assisted bone preparation.","authors":"M.

This study compares prospectively the safety and efficacy of the first 50 open radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) procedures and the first 50 RALP procedures, performed by the same surgeon in the same institution.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nThe patients' baseline demographic, clinical, and oncologic parameters were prospectively recorded. The study end points included oncologic outcome, functional outcomes (at 3 months), and perioperative parameters. Complications were classified according to the modified Clavien system.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo statistically significant differences were noted between the two groups in terms of preoperative patient characteristics and oncologic parameters. The operative time and mean estimated blood loss were lower in the RALP group (P<0.001), but no statistically significant difference was noted in regard to transfusion rates (P=0.362). Mean hospital stay was lower in the RALP group (P<0.001). The minor (Clavien I+II) and major (Clavien III+IV) complication rates were comparable between the two groups. The overall positive margin (PSM) rates were 20% and 18% for RRP and RALP, respectively (P=0.799), while for pT(3) disease, the PSM rates were 26.1% and 22.2%% for RRP and RALP, respectively (P=0.53). The 3-month continence rates were 88% and 90% for RRP and RALP, respectively (P=0.749). For preoperatively potent patients, 3-month potency rates were comparable between the two groups (60.6% and 62.1% in the RRP and the RALP group, respectively, P=0.893).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe early learning curve for RALP appears safe and results in equivalent functional and oncologic outcome, when compared with the results of open surgery.","authors":"P.

However, controversy about the superiority of robot-assisted techniques over conventional freehand techniques remains.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for potentially eligible articles. The outcomes were evaluated in terms of risk ratio (RR) or standardized mean difference (SMD) and the associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Meta-analysis was performed using the RevMan 5.3 software and subgroup analyses were performed based on the robot type for the accuracy of pedicle screw placement.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNine randomized controlled trials with 696 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The results demonstrated that the robot-assisted technique was more accurate in pedicle screw placement than the freehand technique. Subgroup analyses showed that the TINAVI robot-assisted technique was more accurate in screw positions Grade A (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.06-1.14), Grade B (RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.28-0.75), and Grades C + D + E (RR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.09-0.45) than the freehand technique, whereas the Renaissance robot-assisted technique showed the same accuracy as the freehand technique in screw positions Grade A, Grade B, and Grades C + D + E. Furthermore, the robot-assisted techniques showed equivalent postoperative stay, visual analogue scale scores, and Oswestry disability index scores to those of the freehand technique and shorter intraoperative radiation exposure time, fewer radiation dose and proximal facet violations but longer surgical time than the freehand technique.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe robot-assisted technique is more accurate in pedicle screw placement than the freehand technique.

However, such a surgery is technically demanding, limiting its application in nonspecialized centers. The operational features of a robotic system may facilitate overcoming this limitation. Studies have reported the potential advantages of robotic surgery. However, only a few of them have featured the application of this surgery in patients with advanced rectal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (nCRT). From January 2012 to April 2015, after undergoing nCRT, 40 patients with mid or low rectal cancer were operated using the robotic approach at our institution. Another 38 patients who were operated using the conventional laparoscopic approach were matched to patients in the robotic group by sex, age, the body mass index, and procedure. All operations were performed by a single surgical team. The clinicopathological characteristics and short-term outcomes of these patients were compared. To assess the effect of the learning curve on the outcomes, patients in the robotic group were further subdivided into 2 groups according to the sequential order of their procedures, with an equal number of patients in each group. Their outcome measures were compared. The robotic and laparoscopic groups were comparable with regard to pretreatment characteristics, rectal resection type, and pathological examination result. After undergoing nCRT, more patients in the robotic group exhibited clinically advanced diseases. The complication rate was similar between the 2 groups. The operation time and the time to the resumption of a soft diet were significantly prolonged in the robotic group. Further analysis revealed that the difference was mainly observed in the first robotic group. No significant difference was observed between the second robotic and laparoscopic groups. Although the robotic approach may offer potential advantages for rectal surgery, comparable short-term outcomes may be achieved when laparoscopic surgery is performed by experienced surgeons. However, our results suggested a shorter learning curve for robotic surgery for rectal cancer, even in patients who exhibited more advanced disease after undergoing nCRT.","authors":"Yu-Min Huang, Yan-Jiun Huang, P.

The combination of three-dimensional magnified vision and articulated instruments with seven degrees of freedom provide a good and safe alternative to laparoscopic surgery. Indeed some of these features may support the case that robotic surgery may be better than conventional surgery. In this study, we report our experience of robotic surgery by using the first open console, modular robotic platform in Germany, the Versius Surgical System\u00ae. Methods We implemented the Versius Surgical System\u00ae in April 2021 at our centre. Since then, 175 patients received robotic assisted surgery. All patients were included in this study. Data were analysed by using the SPSS (IBM Statistics) Software. Results 175 patients underwent robotic surgery. We started the implementation of the system by performing cholecystectomy. After the first 50 successful operations, we began to perform robotic assisted oncological resections. We saw a learning curve with improvements in total operative time and console time until reaching a standard similar to conventional laparoscopic surgery. The perioperative complication-ratio was equivalent for operations matched the histopathological outcome (MERCURY graduation, R0-staus) at oncological resections. However, four patients had to be revised because of secondary bleeding. Interestingly the total hospital stay for right sided hemicolectomy and oesophagus-resection was shorter than in laparoscopic surgery. Summary In our opinion, the Versius Surgical System\u00ae seems to be a good, promising system and a safe alternative to other robotic systems, although any comparison is still missing. The open design enabling a better communication between console surgeon and bedside-unit assistant as well as the mobile bedside units are very interesting and allow more flexibility. Nevertheless, there are limitations of the system that require a direct comparison with other robotic systems as well as continuous advancement.","authors":"Stefan Wehrmann, Kristin Tischendorf, Torsten Mehlhorn, Annelie Lorenz, Michaela G\u00fcndel, Hagen Rudolph, L.

This study aimed to provide an update on RS in benign gynecological pathology by reporting the scientific recommendations and high-value scientific literature available to date. Materials and Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed. Prospective randomized clinical trials (RCT) and large retrospective trials were included in the present review. Results: Twenty-two studies were considered eligible for the review: eight studies regarding robotic myomectomy, five studies on robotic hysterectomy, five studies about RS in endometriosis treatment, and four studies on robotic pelvic organ prolapse (POP) treatment. Overall, 12 RCT and 10 retrospective studies were included in the analysis. In total 269,728 patients were enrolled, 1721 in the myomectomy group, 265,100 in the hysterectomy group, 1527 in the endometriosis surgical treatment group, and 1380 patients received treatment for POP. Conclusions: Currently, a minimally invasive approach is suggested in benign gynecological pathologies. According to the available evidence, RS has comparable clinical outcomes compared to laparoscopy (LPS). RS allowed a growing number of patients to gain access to MIS and benefit from a minimally invasive treatment, due to a flattened learning curve and enhanced dexterity and visualization.","authors":"V.

Intuitive Surgical has dominated the market during this time period with successive iterations of the da Vinci model. The expiration of patents has opened the RASS market and several new contenders have become available or are currently in development. This comprehensive narrative review aims to explore the merits of each robotic system as well as the evidence and barriers to their use. The newly developed RASS have increased the versality of robotic surgical systems to a wider range of settings through advancement in technology. The increased competition may result in an overall reduction in cost, broadening the accessibility of RASS. Learning curves and training remain a barrier to their use, but the situation appears to be improving through dedicated training programmes. Outcomes for RARP have been well investigated and tend to support improved early functional outcomes. Overall, the rapid developments in the field of robot-assisted surgery indicate the beginning of a promising new era to further enhance urological surgery.","authors":"T. Hughes, B. Rai, S.

Previous generations of robotic surgical systems used a multiport system with a rigid stereo-endoscope and 2 wristed instruments that facilitated transoral robotic surgery.\n\n\nObjective\nTo evaluate a new single-port robotic surgical system in head and neck surgery prospectively through concurrent nonrandomized clinical trials.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nTwo prospective clinical trials were conducted from December 16, 2016, to December 26, 2017, to assess the safety, feasibility, and performance of a flexible single-port robotic surgical system in 4 institutions, including 3 in the United States and 1 in Hong Kong. A total of 47 patients with tumors of the oropharynx were enrolled and underwent surgery. All patients were classified as having American Society of Anesthesiologists class I to III status and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status 0 to 1. An initial cohort of 7 patients underwent staging and endoscopic procedures for benign disease. The remaining 40 patients all had malignant tumors of the oropharynx.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nSafety was measured by the incidence of device-related serious adverse events. Feasibility and performance were measured by the conversion rate from the use of the single-port robotic surgical system to either open surgery or the use of any other transoral technology required to complete the planned procedure. Secondary end points of swallowing function and surgical margins were also measured.\n\n\nResults\nAll 47 patients (8 women and 39 men; mean [SD] age, 61 [8] years) safely underwent transoral resection with the single-port robotic surgical system without conversion to open surgery, laser surgery, or multiport robotic surgery. There were no intraoperative complications or device-related serious adverse events. Mean (SD) estimated intraoperative blood loss per procedure was 15.4 (23.9) mL; no patients received a transfusion. Two patients underwent a planned tracheotomy owing to medical comorbidity (previous chemoradiotherapy; obesity and severe sleep apnea). Two patients (4%) had grade III or IV postoperative hemorrhage, requiring a return to the operating room; however, both patients had medical comorbidities requiring the use of antithrombotic medication. The incidence of positive margins for patients with oropharyngeal malignancy was 3% (1 of 40). Within 30 days, 45 patients (96%) were eating by mouth and without the need for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nThis study describes the results of phase 2 clinical testing of a next-generation, robotic surgical system using a single-port architecture. The use of the device appears to be feasible, safe, and effective for transoral robotic surgery of oropharyngeal tumors.\n\n\nTrial Registration\nClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT03010813 and NCT03049280.","authors":"F.

Its diagnostic and prognostic value in colorectal cancer (CRC) was determined using tandem mass spectrometry in 199 individuals (137 with CRC) and, during a three-day follow up, in 60 patients undergoing colorectal surgery. Citrulline was decreased and asymmetric (ADMA) and symmetric (SDMA) dimethylarginines and dimethylamine (DMA) were increased in CRC. The DMA increase corresponded with CRC advancement while arginine, ADMA, and SDMA levels were higher in left-sided cancers. Arginine, citrulline, ADMA, and DMA dropped and SDMA increased post incision. Females experienced a more substantial drop in arginine. The arginine and ADMA dynamics depended on blood loss. The initial SDMA increase was higher in patients requiring transfusions. Postoperative dynamics in arginine and dimethylarginines differed in robot-assisted and open surgery. Concomitant SDMA, citrulline, and DMA quantification displayed a 92% accuracy in detecting CRC. Monitoring changes in arginine, ADMA, and SDMA in the early postoperative period predicted postoperative ileus with 84% and surgical site infections with 90% accuracy. Changes in ADMA predicted operative morbidity with 90% and anastomotic leakage with 77% accuracy. If positively validated, L-arginine\/NO pathway metabolites may facilitate CRC screening and surveillance, support differential diagnosis, and assist in clinical decision-making regarding patients recovering from colorectal surgery.","authors":"Iwona Bednarz-Misa, Mariusz G.

Methods Information on patients who underwent breast cancer operation by the principal investigator during the period of 2011 to 2020 was collected from a single institute for analysis. The clinical outcome, trend, and cost of MABS were analyzed and compared with conventional breast surgery (CBS). Results A total of 824 breast cancer patients operated by a single surgeon were enrolled in this study: 254 received CBS and 570 received MABS, namely, 476 EABS and 94 RABS. From 2011 to 2020, the number of MABS performed annually has shown an increasing trend. Compared with CBS, MABS such as breast conserving surgery and nipple sparing mastectomy (NSM) have effectively reduced wound scar length. Since the sequential uprise from conventional NSM (C-NSM), dual-axillary-areolar-incision two dimensional (2D) endoscopic assisted NSM (E-NSM), single-axillary-incision E-NSM, robotic assisted NSM (R-NSM), and single-port 3D E-NSM, the development of minimal access mastectomies increasingly paralleled with NSM. The operation time of various MABS decreased significantly and showed no statistical difference compared with CBS. R-NSM was associated with highest cost, followed by 3D E-NSM, E-NSM, and C-NSM. The positive surgical margin rate and local recurrence rate of MABS and CBS were not statistically different. Conclusion MABS showed comparable clinical outcome and preliminary oncologic safety as CBS and has been increasingly performed as the surgical treatment of breast cancer, especially minimal access NSM.","authors":"H.

The single-port robot was specifically designed for narrow-aperture surgery and is a promising platform for minimally invasive transanal surgery. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this phase II trial is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the initial clinical experience with single-port robot transanal minimally invasive surgery. DESIGN: In a prospective phase II trial, patients with rectal neoplasms eligible for local excision were enrolled for single-port robotic transanal minimally invasive surgery. SETTING: The study was conducted between October 2018 and March 2020 at a tertiary referral hospital. PATIENTS\/INTERVENTION: Twenty-six consecutive patients underwent single-port robotic transanal minimally invasive surgery resection of rectal lesions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point of the study was the efficacy and safety of single-port robotic transanal minimally invasive surgery. RESULTS: There were 13 men and 13 women, with an average lesion size of 2.9 cm (range, 1.0\u20136.0 cm) and average level of 4.8 cm from the anorectal ring (range, 0\u201330 cm). Ten patients had a preoperative diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, 7 of whom received neoadjuvant chemoradiation (range, 4500\u20135580 cGy with concurrent oral capecitabine). Eighty-eight percent of cases were completed by single-port robotic transanal minimally invasive surgery; 2 were converted to transanal endoscopic microsurgery, and 1 patient underwent a low anterior resection. There were no piecemeal extractions, and all margins were negative on final pathology. There were no mortalities, and the morbidity rate was 15.4%. There have been no local recurrences, with a mean follow-up of 5.8 months (range, 0\u201315.9 months). LIMITATIONS: The study was limited by small sample size, short-term follow up, and a single-surgeon experience. CONCLUSION: Single-port robotic transanal minimally invasive surgery procedures are safe and feasible in patients with select benign and malignant rectal lesions. Future trials will need to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of single-port robotic transanal minimally invasive surgery. See Video Abstract at http:\/\/links.lww.com\/DCR\/B605.

This technique was designed to offer a new minimally invasive approach, without soft-palate splitting, that avoids the rhinological side effects of classic endonasal approaches. METHODS The authors performed a prospective study of TORS in patients with symptomatic sellar tumors. Specific anatomical features were required for inclusion in the study and were determined on the basis of preoperative open-mouth CT scans of the brain. The main outcome measure was sellar accessibility using the robot. Resection quality, mean operative time, postoperative changes in patients' vision, side effects, and complications were additionally reported. RESULTS Between February and May 2016, 4 patients (all female, mean age 49.5 years) underwent TORS for resection of sellar tumors as participants in this study. All patients presented with symptomatic visual deficits confirmed as bitemporal hemianopsia. All tumors had a suprasellar portion and a cystic part. In all 4 cases, the operation was performed via TORS, without the need for a second surgery. Sella turcica accessibility was satisfactory in all cases. In 3 cases, tumor resection was complete. The mean operative time was 2 hours 43 minutes. Three patients had a significant visual improvement at Day 1. No rhinological side effects or complications in patients occurred. No pathological examination was performed regarding the fluid component of the tumors. There was 1 postoperative delayed CSF leak and 1 case of transient diabetes insipidus. Side effects specific to TORS included minor sore throat, transient hypernasal speech, and 1 case of delayed otitis media. The mean length of hospital stay and mean follow up were 8.25 days and 82 days, respectively. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this is the first report of the surgical treatment of sellar tumors by means of a minimally invasive TORS. This approach using the da Vinci Surgical System seems feasible and constitutes an innovative neurosurgical technique that may avoid the adverse side effects and technical disadvantages of the classic transsphenoidal route. Moreover, TORS allows an inferosuperior approach to the sella turcica, which is a key point, as the tumor is approached in the direction of its growth.","authors":"D. Chauvet, S.

Background: Open simultaneous resection of colorectal cancer and synchronous liver metastases is widely performed and the potential cure for eligible patients. However, the feasibility of robotic simultaneous resection of primary and secondary liver lesions has not been established as a treatment option for metastatic rectal cancer. Patients and methods: A single-center randomized controlled trial was conducted at a hospital in China. Enrolling patients were aged from 18 to 75 years and diagnosed with surgically resectable metastatic rectal cancer (distal extension to \u226415 cm from the anal margin). Patients selected for simultaneous resection were randomly assigned to have robotic or open surgery at a 1:1 ratio. The primary endpoint was the incidence rate of complications within 30 days after surgery. Secondary endpoints were bladder, sexual function, 3-year disease-free survival, and overall survival. Results: A total of 171 patients were enrolled in this trial with 86 in the robotic group and 85 in the open group. As a result, patients in the robotic group demonstrated fewer complications within 30 days after surgery than those in the open group (31.4 vs. 57.6%, P=0.014) and no mortality seen in either group. Patients in the robotic group had less blood loss [mean (SD), 125.5 (38.3) vs. 211.6 (68.7) ml; P<0.001], faster bowel function recovery [mean (SD), 63.7 (27.4) vs. 93.8 (33.5) h P<0.001] and shorter hospital stay [mean (SD), 8.0 (2.2) vs. 10.7 (5.4) days; P<0.001] compared with those in the open group. The robotic group had a faster recovery of bladder and sexual function at 3 months after surgery than that of the open group. The 3-year disease-free survival rate (39.5 vs. 35.3%, P=0.739) and the 3-year overall survival rate (76.7 vs. 72.9%, P=0.712) were not statistically significant between the two groups. Conclusions: In our randomized clinical trial, robotic simultaneous resection treatment of patients with rectal cancer and liver metastases resulted in fewer surgical complications, and a faster recovery to those of open surgery. Oncological outcomes showed no significant difference between the two groups.","authors":"W. Chang, Qinghai Ye, Donghao Xu, Yu Liu, Shizhao Zhou, L. Ren, G.

With a substantial body of evidence that demonstrates its efficacy in the treatment of rectal cancer, robotic surgery will soon become another conventional treatment. However, further investigations and randomized trials focusing on primary endpoints are needed to establish some advantages for robot-assisted colon surgery. Da Vinci Single-Site\u24c7 and SP\u24c7 platforms were developed to overcome the shortcomings of single-port laparoscopic surgery. Despite the currently insufficient evidence, it appears that the SP platform addresses many of the limitations of single-port transabdominal or transanal surgery. Robotic transanal minimally invasive surgery and total mesorectal excision were developed to overcome some of the limitations of conventional platforms, using wristed instrumentation to enhance dexterity and ergonomics. Studies on the effectiveness and viability of this novel approach are ongoing. The near-infrared fluorescence technique, real-time stereotactic navigation technology, and other surgical data platforms based on artificial intelligence incorporated into the robotic system will play an important role in improving outcomes. Robotic systems for advanced colorectal cancer offer technical advantages for complex and precise surgeries. If the cost of robotic surgery is reduced by expanding its indications and enhancing competition among different robotic platforms, it will provide clinical benefits to more patients and reduce social healthcare costs.","authors":"Sung Uk Bae","year":2022,"url":"https:\/\/www.semanticscholar.org\/paper\/3b95c41e6781e8932446a6e9d6b98ba5961ae3b0"},{"title":"Implementation and outcomes of HugoTM RAS System in robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy","abstract":"ABSTRACT Background The results and benefits of Robotic-assisted Radical Prostatectomy (RARP) are already established in the literature. However, new robotic platforms have been released recently in the market and their outcomes are still unknown. In this scenario, our objective is to describe our experience implementing the HugoTM RAS robot and report the clinical data of patients who underwent Robotic-assisted Radical Prostatectomy. Material and Methods We retrospectively analyzed fifteen consecutive patients who underwent RARP with HugoTM RAS System (Medtronic, Minneapolis, USA) from June to October 2021. The patients underwent transperitoneal RARP on lithotomy position, using six trocars (4 robotic trocars and 2 for the assistant). We reported the clinical feasibility and safety of this platform, assessing perioperative data, including complications and early outcomes. Continuous variables were reported as median and interquartile ranges, categorical variables as frequencies and proportions. Results and Limitations All procedures were safe and feasible with no major complications or conversion. Median operative time was 235 minutes (213-271), and median estimated blood loss was 300ml (100-310). Positive surgical margins were reported in 5 patients (33%). The median hospitalization time was 2 days (2-2), and the median time to remove the foley was 7 days (7-7). On the first appointment four weeks after surgery, all patients had undetectable PSA values, and 61% were continent. Conclusions We described preliminary results with safe and feasible procedures performed with HugoTM RAS System robotic platform. The surgeries were successfully executed with acceptable perioperative outcomes, without conversions or major complications. However, as this technology is very recent, further studies with a long-term follow-up are awaited to access postoperative functional and oncological outcomes.","authors":"Claudia Gonz\u00e1lez Alfano, M.

Robot-assisted surgery was performed in 37 patients, and conventional surgery by sternotomy in 108 patients. Propensity score matching was done between two groups with variables of age, sex, size of the mass, myasthenia gravis, resection of other organ and pathological diagnosis. Thirty-four patients from the robot group and 34 from the open group were matched, fitting the model. The clinical outcomes of matched groups were compared.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the robot group, mediastinal cyst consisted of 47.1% (16 of 34), thymoma 32.4% (11 of 34), thymic carcinoma 8.8% (3 of 34), thymic hyperplasia 8.8% (3 of 34) and liposarcoma 2.9% (1 of 34). The mean duration of follow-up was 1.11 \u00b1 0.21 and 1.85 \u00b1 0.19 years for the robot and open groups, respectively. There were no mortality or recurrence in both groups during the follow-up. There were no significant differences in operation time, postoperative white blood cell and C-reactive protein increase, maximum visual analogue scale score for pain as well as postoperative intensive care unit care between the two groups. The robot group revealed a lesser number of drains (1.09 \u00b1 0.1 vs 1.41 \u00b1 0.1) and 24-h tube drainage (189.4 \u00b1 20.5 vs 397.6 \u00b1 52.6 ml), lower haemoglobin loss (0.54 \u00b1 0.4 vs 1.35 \u00b1 0.1 g\/dl) and haematocrit decrease (1.92 \u00b1 0.5 vs 3.85 \u00b1 0.4%), shorter chest tube days (1.53 \u00b1 0.2 vs 3.06 \u00b1 0.2) and length of hospital stay (2.65 \u00b1 0.2 vs 5.53 \u00b1 0.8) after operation, which were all statistically significant. Although statistically insignificant, there were no postoperative complications in the robot group, but there were 5 (14.7%) in the open group (P = 0.063).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn carefully selected patients with relatively smaller sized masses, robot-assisted surgery resulted in excellent early clinical outcomes with lesser tube drainage, lower blood loss, shorter tube days and length of hospital stay without any postoperative complications, compared with the matched open group. Further investigation for long-term clinical outcomes and oncological outcomes is required for a robotic approach. Particularly, long-term follow-up for the local recurrence rate according to the pathological diagnoses is required.","authors":"Y. Seong, C. Kang, J. Choi, Hye-seon Kim, J. Jeon, I. Park, Y. T.

This article discusses a transanal robotic surgery technique to perform full-thickness resections of benign and malignant rectal neoplasms. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe an initial experience with robotic transanal minimally invasive surgery. DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients who underwent robotic transanal minimally invasive surgery. SETTINGS: The study was conducted at a high-volume colorectal surgery practice with a large health maintenance organization. PATIENTS: Patients at Southern California Kaiser Permanente with early rectal cancer and rectal polyps amenable to transanal excision were included. INTERVENTIONS: Transanal resection of rectal tumors were removed using robotic transanal minimally invasive surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Local recurrence of rectal pathology was measured. RESULTS: A total of 58 patients underwent robotic transanal minimally invasive surgery with full-thickness rectal resection by 4 surgeons for the following indications: rectal cancer (n = 28), rectal polyp (n = 18), rectal carcinoid (n = 11), and rectal GI stromal tumor (n = 1). Mean operative time was 66.2 minutes (range, 17\u2013180\u2009min). The mean tumor height from the anal verge was 8.8\u2009cm (range, 4\u201314\u2009cm), and the mean specimen size was 3.3\u2009cm (range, 1.3\u20138.2\u2009cm). A total of 57 (98.3%) of 58 specimens were intact, and 55 (94.8%) of 58 specimens had negative surgical margins. At a mean follow-up of 11.5 months (range, 0.3\u201333.3 mo), 3 patients (5.5%) developed local recurrences, and all underwent successful salvage surgery. LIMITATIONS: The study was limited by being a retrospective, nonrandomized trial with short follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Robotic transanal minimally invasive surgery is a safe, oncologically effective surgical approach for rectal polyps and early rectal cancers. It offers the oncologic benefits and perioperative complication profile of other transanal minimally invasive surgical approaches but also enhances surgeon ergonomics and provides an efficient transanal rectal platform.

A virtual preoperative restorative and surgical plan was created from a cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan and matched to the surgical workspace on the day of surgery via either a tooth-based or a bone-based fiducial splint. Intraoperatively, the surgeon manipulated a handpiece attached to haptic robotic guidance arm. A variety of drills and implants were used in this series. Both the osteotomy and the implant placement were guided by 3D haptic constraints according to the virtual plan. A postoperative CBCT scans permitted the calculation of the deviations of the actual implant placement compared to the plan for accuracy. Precision was calculated by comparing standard deviations from published literature.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe implants were evenly distributed by jaw with 47% placed in the maxilla and 53% in the mandible. The mean \u00b1 standard deviation signed depth deviation was 0.14 \u00b1 0.87 mm proud. The global angular deviation averaged 1.42 \u00b1 1.53 degrees with 95% confidence limits of 1.24 degrees and 1.60 degrees. The crown of the actual placed implant showed an average deviation from the plan of 1.10 \u00b1 0.69 mm and the apex a deviation of 1.12 \u00b1 0.69 mm. Haptic robotic-guidance showed greater precision than freehand, static computer-guided and dynamic computer-guided implant placement.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis large clinical series of 273 implants shows a high accuracy of implant placement in comparison to published accuracy for angular deviations for any technology as well as demonstrating statistically greater precision. Long-term clinical studies are necessary to establish the true effect of increased accuracy on clinical outcomes. Using haptic robotic guidance provides accurate implant placement while allowing additional benefits compared to computer-guided surgery, namely full visualization of the surgical field and the ability to change the plan intra-operatively.","authors":"Jay M.

After a hype in the early 2000s case numbers decreased but due to technological improvements renewed interest can be noted. We assessed the current activities and outcomes in robotically assisted cardiac surgery on the European continent. Methods Data were collected in an international anonymized registry of 26 European centers with a robotic cardiac surgery program. Results During a 4-year period (2016\u20132019), 2,563 procedures were carried out [30.0% female, 58.5 (15.4) years old, EuroSCORE II 1.56 (1.74)], including robotically assisted coronary bypass grafting (n = 1266, 49.4%), robotic mitral or tricuspid valve surgery (n = 945, 36.9%), isolated atrial septal defect closure (n = 225, 8.8%), left atrial myxoma resection (n = 54, 2.1%), and other procedures (n = 73, 2.8%). The number of procedures doubled during the study period (from n = 435 in 2016 to n = 923 in 2019).

Also, RS was associated with a shorter hospital stay (MD, \u20130.69 days; 95% CI, \u20131.12 to \u20130.26), a lower estimated blood loss (MD, \u201319.49 mL; 95% CI, \u201327.10 to \u201311.89) and a longer proximal margin (MD, 2.29 cm; 95% CI, 1.11-3.47). However, RS was associated with a longer surgery time (MD, 51.00 minutes; 95% CI, 39.38\u201362.62). Conclusion We found that the potential benefits of perioperative and short-term outcomes for RS than for CLS. For a more accurate understanding of RS for colonic cancer patients, robust comparative studies and randomized clinical trials are required.","authors":"Sungwon Lim, Jin Hee Kim, S.

Robot-assisted surgery is an advanced form of MAS. The Versius\u00ae surgical robot system was developed with the aim of overcoming some of the challenges associated with existing surgical robots. The present study was designed to investigate the feasibility, clinical safety, and effectiveness of the Versius system in MAS. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive search was carried out in the Medline, Web of Science Core Collection (Indexes = SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, A & HCI Timespan), and Scopus databases for articles published until February 2022. The keywords used were Versius robot, visceral, colorectal, gynecology, and urologic surgeries. Articles on the use of the Versius robot in minimal access surgery (MAS) were included in the review. Results: Seventeen articles were reviewed for the study. The investigation comprised a total of 328 patients who had been operated on with this robot system, of which 48.3%, 14.2%, and 37.5% underwent colorectal, visceral, and gynecological procedures, respectively. Postoperative and major complications within 30 days varied from 7.4% to 39%. No major complications and no readmissions or reoperations were reported in visceral and gynecological surgeries. Readmission and reoperation rates in colorectal surgeries were 0\u20139%. Some procedures required conversion to conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS) or open surgery, and all procedures were completed successfully. Based on the studies reviewed in the present report, we conclude that the Versius robot can be used safely and effectively in MAS. Conclusions: A review of the published literature revealed that the Versius system is safe and effective in minimal access surgery. However, the data should be viewed with caution until randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been performed. Studies on the use of this robotic system in oncological surgery must include survival as one of the addressed outcomes.","authors":"I. Alkatout, H. Salehiniya, L.

Inclusion criterion: robotic surgery technical skills tools. Exclusion criteria: non-technical, laparoscopy or open skills only. Manual tools and automated performance metrics (APMs) were analysed using Messick's concept of validity and the Oxford Centre of Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) Levels of Evidence and Recommendation (LoR). A bespoke tool analysed artificial intelligence (AI) studies. The Modified Downs\u2013Black checklist was used to assess risk of bias. Results Two hundred and forty-seven studies were analysed, identifying: 8 global rating scales, 26 procedure-\/task-specific tools, 3 main error-based methods, 10 simulators, 28 studies analysing APMs and 53 AI studies. Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills and the da Vinci Skills Simulator were the most evaluated tools at LoR 1 (OCEBM). Three procedure-specific tools, 3 error-based methods and 1 non-simulator APMs reached LoR 2.

Methods We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase databases, Clinicaltrials, and Opengrey through March 24, 2020, including references of qualifying articles. English-language, original investigations in humans about robot-assisted and laparoscopic hepatectomy were included. Titles, abstracts, and articles were reviewed by at least 2 independent readers. Continuous and dichotomous variables were compared by the weighted mean difference (WMD) and odds ratio (OR), respectively. Results Of 936 titles identified in our original search, 28 articles met our criteria, involving 3544 patients. Compared with laparoscopy, the robot-assisted groups had longer operative time (WMD: 36.93; 95% CI, 19.74\u201354.12; P < 0.001), lower conversion rate (OR: 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46\u20130.87; P = 0.005), higher transfusion rate (WMD: 2.39; 95% CI, 1.51\u20133.76; P < 0.001) and higher total cost (WMD:0.49; 95% CI, 0.42\u20130.55; P < 0.001).

The comparison focuses on operative times, surgical outcomes, and surgical complications associated with the various surgical techniques. PubMed was the main search engine utilized in search of study data. The review included studies of various designs that included at least 25 women who had undergone robotic gynecologic surgery. Fifty-five studies (42 comparative and 13 non-comparative) met eligibility criteria. After careful analysis, we found that robotic surgery was consistently connected to shorter post-surgical hospitalization when compared to open surgery, a difference less significant when compared to laparoscopic surgery. Also, it seems that robotic surgery is highly feasible in gynecology. There are quite a few inconsistencies regarding operative times and estimated blood loss between the different approaches, though in the majority of studies estimated blood loss was lower in the robotic surgery group. The high variance in operative times resulted from the difference in surgeon\u2019s experience. The decision whether robotic surgery should become mainstream in gynecological surgery or remain another surgical technique in the gynecological surgeon\u2019s toolbox requires quite a few more randomized controlled clinical trials.

Participants were then randomly assigned to 4 training groups: Dome (n = 29), dV-Trainer (n = 30), and DVSS (n = 32) that trained to benchmarks and control (n = 32) that trained using locally available robotic skills curricula. The primary outcome was participant performance after training based on task errors and duration on 5 basic robotic tasks (knot tying, continuous suturing, cutting, dissection, and vessel coagulation) using an avian tissue model (transfer-test). Secondary outcomes included cognitive test scores, GEARS ratings, and robot familiarity checklist scores.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll groups demonstrated significant performance improvement after skills training (P < 0.01).

However, there are still several technical disadvantages limiting its use. Robotic gastrectomy (RG) is an emerging minimally invasive technique that overcomes some of these limitations. This study compares RG with LG in the treatment of gastric cancer by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of all published literature.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nComparative studies published between January 1991 and April 2013 in the major databases were systematically searched. Evaluated end points were operative, postoperative, and oncological outcomes. Pooled odds ratios and weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using either the fixed-effects model or random-effects model.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNine nonrandomized comparative studies with 2495 patients were included, of which 736 procedures were robotic and 1759 were laparoscopic. RG was associated with a lower intraoperative blood loss and a shorter time to oral intake compared with LG. However, it was associated with a significantly longer operative time and shorter distal resection margin. In addition, there was no significant difference in the number of retrieved lymph nodes, proximal resection margin, rate of conversion to open surgery, overall morbidity, anastomotic leakage, anastomotic stenosis, intestinal obstruction, time to first flatus, length of hospital stay, and perioperative mortality rates between the two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRG is comparable to LG, with respect to safety, technical feasibility, and oncological effectiveness in the treatment of gastric cancer. However, there is a need for well-designed prospective randomized controlled studies comparing the two procedures with long-term follow-up, to inform future practice.","authors":"J. Xiong, Q.

Many difficulties encountered in laparoscopic IA can be overcome with hybrid robot-assisted IA or recently with totally robotic procedures. In the literature, few works have been published comparing laparoscopic, hybrid, and totally robotic right colectomies. The aim of this study is to retrospectively analyze the improvements brought on by the evolution of robotic surgery at our specialized center.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nTwo hundred six (hybrid and totally) robotic right colectomies (RRCs) with IA were compared with 160 laparoscopic right colectomies (LRCs) with EA. A separate analysis carried out by the robotic group compared 30 totally robotic right colectomies (TRRCs) with 176 hybrid robot-assisted right colectomies (HRRCs). Demographics, pathological features, operative details, and postoperative outcomes were retrospectively analyzed from a prospectively maintained database.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe groups were comparable with respect to demographics and tumor staging. When compared with LRC, RRC showed shorter time to first flatus (P\u2009<\u2009.001), stools (P\u2009<\u2009.001), solid diet (P\u2009<\u2009.001), and discharge (P\u2009<\u2009.001). The number of lymph nodes harvested was 23.13\u2009\u00b1\u200911.2 in RRC versus 20.5\u2009\u00b1\u200911.2 in LRC (P\u2009=\u2009.031). Operative time was longer in RRC (253.0\u2009\u00b1\u200947 minutes versus 209.9\u2009\u00b1\u200964 minutes; P\u2009<\u2009.001), but conversion to open (2.4% versus 18.1%; P\u2009<\u2009.001), anastomotic leaks (0.5% versus 5%; P\u2009=\u2009.012), and bleeding (0.3% versus 4.4%; P\u2009=\u2009.024) were significantly less frequent. Subsequent analysis shows no significant increase in operative time in TRRC versus HRRC (261.0\u2009\u00b1\u200941 minutes versus 251.6\u2009\u00b1\u200947.6 minutes; P\u2009=\u2009.310). Even if not statistically significant, TRRC showed faster bowel function recovery and tolerance to solid diet.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe confirmed the clinical advantages of RRC with IA over LRC with EA in postoperative recovery outcomes and complication rate.

A multicenter assessment of 320 patients","abstract":"Robot-assisted platforms in spine surgery have rapidly developed into an attractive technology for both the surgeon and patient. Although current literature is promising, more clinical data is needed. The purpose of this paper is to determine the effect of robot-related complications on clinical outcomes This multicenter study included adult (\u226518 years old) patients who underwent robot-assisted lumbar fusion surgery from 2012-2019. The minimum follow-up was 1 year after surgery. Both bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine if robot-related factors were associated with reoperation within 1 year after primary surgery. A total of 320 patients were included in this study. The mean (standard deviation) Charlson Comorbidity Index was 1.2 (1.2) and 52.5% of patients were female. Intraoperative robot complications occurred in 3.4% of patients and included intraoperative exchange of screw (0.9%), robot abandonment (2.5%), and return to the operating room for screw exchange (1.3%). The 1-year reoperation rate was 4.4%. Robot factors, including robot time per screw, open vs. percutaneous, and robot system, were not statistically different between those who required revision surgery and those who did not (P>0.05). Patients with robot complications were more likely to have prolonged length of hospital stay and blood transfusion, but were not at higher risk for 1-year reoperations. The most common reasons for reoperation were wound complications (2.2%) and persistent symptoms due to inadequate decompression (1.5%). In the multivariate analysis, robot related factors and complications were not independent risk factors for 1-year reoperations. This is the largest multicenter study to focus on robot-assisted lumbar fusion outcomes. Our findings demonstrate that 1-year reoperation rates are low and do not appear to be influenced by robot-related factors and complications; however, robot-related complications may increase the risk for greater blood loss requiring a blood transfusion and longer length of stay.","authors":"Nathan J.

Herein, we report on recipient outcome in the robotic uterus transplantation trial of 2017\u20132019. The eight recipients had congenital uterine aplasia. The donors were six mothers, one sister, and one family friend. Donor surgery was by robotic-assisted laparoscopy. Recipient surgery was by laparotomy and vascular anastomoses to the external iliacs. The duration (median (ranges)) of recipient surgery, blood loss, measured (left\/right) uterine artery blood flow after reperfusion, and length of hospital stay were 5.15 h (4.5\u20136.6), 300 mL (150\u2013600), 43.5 mL\/min (20\u2013125)\/37.5 mL\/min (10\u201398), and 6 days (5\u20139), respectively. Postoperative uterine perfusion evaluated by color Doppler showed open anastomoses but restricted blood distribution in two cases. Repeated cervical biopsies in these two cases initially showed ischemia and, later, necrosis. Endometrial growth was not seen, and hysterectomy was later performed, with pathology showing partly viable myometrium and fibrosis but necrosis towards the cavity. The other six patients acquired regular menstrual cyclicity. Surgery was performed in two patients to correct vaginal stenosis. Reversible rejection episodes were seen in two patients. In conclusion, the rate of viable uterine grafts during the initial 6-months of the present study (75%) leaves room for improvement in the inclusion\/exclusion criteria of donors and in surgical techniques.

The use of laparoscopic (keyhole) and robot-assisted surgery has improved operative safety but the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these options remains uncertain.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThis study aimed to determine the relative clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of robotic radical prostatectomy compared with laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in the treatment of localised prostate cancer within the UK NHS.\n\n\nDATA SOURCES\nMEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, BIOSIS, Science Citation Index and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from January 1995 until October 2010 for primary studies. Conference abstracts from meetings of the European, American and British Urological Associations were also searched. Costs were obtained from NHS sources and the manufacturer of the robotic system. Economic model parameters and distributions not obtained in the systematic review were derived from other literature sources and an advisory expert panel.\n\n\nREVIEW METHODS\nEvidence was considered from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised comparative studies of men with clinically localised prostate cancer (cT1 or cT2); outcome measures included adverse events, cancer related, functional, patient driven and descriptors of care. Two reviewers abstracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. For meta-analyses, a Bayesian indirect mixed-treatment comparison was used. Cost-effectiveness was assessed using a discrete-event simulation model.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe searches identified 2722 potentially relevant titles and abstracts, from which 914 reports were selected for full-text eligibility screening. Of these, data were included from 19,064 patients across one RCT and 57 non-randomised comparative studies, with very few studies considered at low risk of bias. The results of this study, although associated with some uncertainty, demonstrated that the outcomes were generally better for robotic than for laparoscopic surgery for major adverse events such as blood transfusion and organ injury rates and for rate of failure to remove the cancer (positive margin) (odds ratio 0.69; 95% credible interval 0.51 to 0.96; probability outcome favours robotic prostatectomy = 0.987). The predicted probability of a positive margin was 17.6% following robotic prostatectomy compared with 23.6% for laparoscopic prostatectomy. Restriction of the meta-analysis to studies at low risk of bias did not change the direction of effect but did decrease the precision of the effect size. There was no evidence of differences in cancer-related, patient-driven or dysfunction outcomes. The results of the economic evaluation suggested that when the difference in positive margins is equivalent to the estimates in the meta-analysis of all included studies, robotic radical prostatectomy was on average associated with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year that is less than threshold values typically adopted by the NHS (\u00a330,000) and becomes further reduced when the surgical capacity is high.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS\nThe main limitations were the quantity and quality of the data available on cancer-related outcomes and dysfunction.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study demonstrated that robotic prostatectomy had lower perioperative morbidity and a reduced risk of a positive surgical margin compared with laparoscopic prostatectomy although there was considerable uncertainty. Robotic prostatectomy will always be more costly to the NHS because of the fixed capital and maintenance charges for the robotic system. Our modelling showed that this excess cost can be reduced if capital costs of equipment are minimised and by maintaining a high case volume for each robotic system of at least 100-150 procedures per year. This finding was primarily driven by a difference in positive margin rate. There is a need for further research to establish how positive margin rates impact on long-term outcomes.\n\n\nFUNDING\nThe National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme.","authors":"C.

The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of SLN mapping between laparoscopic and robotic surgery. One-hundred-and-forty women with histologically confirmed endometrial cancer, were treated with a minimally invasive hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and SLN mapping. After anaesthetic induction, ICG was superficially injected into cervical submucosa and deeply injected into the cervical stroma at the 3 and 9 o\u2019clock positions (1.25\u2009mg\/site). Eleven cases were abandoned after ICG injection (laparoscopic surgery seven cases and robotic surgery four cases) because of obesity, technical difficulty and peritoneal disease. One-hundred-and-eleven patients were analysed. Seventy-six patients had a laparoscopic procedure and 33 patients had robotic surgery. The overall and bilateral detection rates were 97% and 83% for laparoscopic surgery and 88% and 73% for robotic surgery. Laparoscopic surgery was superior to robotic surgery in terms of overall detection (p-value .046). There was no significant difference in the intra-operative SLN identification time or SLN dissection time between laparoscopy and robotic surgery (p-value .247 and .145, respectively). Further research is required to compare laparoscopy and robotic surgery in terms of SLN detection. Impact Statement What is already known on this subject? Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping aims to avoid complications and provide useful staging information for endometrial cancer. ICG has been shown to improve the detection rate and NPV compared with other tracers (blue dye and technetium 99). No data exists comparing SLN mapping rates using ICG in laparoscopy and robotic surgery. What do the results of this study add? The overall and bilateral detection rates were 97% and 83% for laparoscopic surgery and 88% and 73% for robotic surgery. Laparoscopic surgery was superior to robotic surgery in terms of overall detection. There was no significant difference in the intra-operative SLN identification time or SLN dissection time between laparoscopy and robotic surgery. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and\/or further research?: This study confirms that laparoscopy and robotic surgery are not different in terms of bilateral detection rate and SLN operating time; the study population is small.","authors":"W.

Here, we describe a case series of patients who had undergone trans-subxiphoid robotic surgery-with a special focus on short-term outcomes.\n\n\nMethods\nBetween January 2018 and January 2019, a total of 20 patients underwent trans-subxiphoid robotic surgery for maximal thymectomy or removal of anterior mediastinal masses. A 3-cm longitudinal incision was performed below the xiphoid process, through which carbon dioxide was insufflated and a camera port was inserted. Subsequently, the lower sections of the mediastinal pleura were detached bilaterally-followed by the creation of two bilateral 1-cm skin incisions on the anterior axillary line in the sixth intercostal space for the insertion of robotic arms. Upon completion of port positioning, the surgical robot was docked.\n\n\nResults\nAll robotic surgery procedures were successfully completed.

Robotic-assisted microsurgery has been implemented in lymphatic surgery as well as soft tissue reconstructive surgery at our institution over the past 2.5 years. Our study gives an insight into the details and outcomes of the first 100 consecutive (super-) microsurgical anastomoses in peripheral and central lymphatic reconstruction performed with the Symani\u00ae Surgical System between 2021 and 2024. In total, 67 patients were treated, receiving robotic-assisted lymphatic reconstruction with lymphatic tissue transfer (LTT) and\/or lymphovenous anastomoses (LVA)\/lympholymphatic anastomoses (LLA). No anastomosis-associated complications were recorded postoperatively. The majority of patients reported a postoperative improvement of their lymphedema or central lymphatic disorder. In conclusion, we show the successful implementation of the Symani\u00ae Surgical System into our clinical practice of lymphatic reconstruction. Although the necessary intraoperative setup and the use of intrinsic motion scaling lead to a slight increase in operating time, the presented study demonstrates the advantages of robotic assistance which becomes particularly evident in lymphatic surgery due to the involved deep surgical sites and the need for supermicrosurgical techniques.

Besides the several advantages associated with minimal invasiveness, this approach bridged the gap between the benefits of vaginal surgery and the surgical success rates of open abdominal procedures. The most commonly performed procedure for suspension of the vaginal apex for postoperative vaginal prolapse by robotic-assisted laparoscopy is the sacrocolpopexy. Conventional laparoscopic application of this procedure was first reported in 1994 by Nezhat et al. and had not gained widespread adoption due to lengthy learning curve associated with laparoscopic suturing. Since FDA approval of the da Vinci\u00ae robot for gynecologic surgery in 2005, minimally invasive abdominal surgery for pelvic organ prolapse has become increasingly popular, as robotic-assisted laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy is an option for those surgeons without experience or training in the conventional route. Robotic surgery has made its way into the armamentarium of POP treatment and has allowed pelvic surgeons to adapt the \"gold standard\" technique of abdominal sacrocolpopexy to a minimally invasive approach with improved intraoperative morbidity and decreased convalescence. In fact, repair of pelvic organ prolapse can be performed robotically, and sometimes surgeons can feel suturing and dissection during the procedures less challenging with the assistance of the robot. However, even if robotic surgery may confer many benefits over conventional laparoscopy, these advantages should continue to be weighed against the cost of the technology. To date, as long-term outcomes, evidence about robotic sacrocolpopexy for a repair of pelvic organ prolapse are not conclusive, and much more investigations are needed to evaluate subjective and objective outcomes, perioperative and postoperative adverse events, and costs associated with these procedures. It is plausible to think that the main advantage is that robotics may lead to a widespread adoption of minimally invasive techniques in the field of pelvic floor reconstructive surgery. The following review will address the development and current state of robotic assistance in treating pelvic floor reconstruction discussing available data about the techniques of robotic prolapse repair as well as morbidity, costs and clinical outcomes.","authors":"A.

The utilization of RARC with intracorporeal urinary diversion (ICUD) has increased during the last 15 years. This increase is primarily noted for ICUD with ileal conduits, but with a lesser extent also for IC neobladders, with an increase from 7% in 2005 to 17% in 2016. However, these observations are limited to a few centers of excellence reflecting the fact that IC ONB formation is regarded as technically challenging and time-consuming with a steep learning curve. The objective of this review is to summarize the current data about RARC with IC ileal ONB in terms of patient selection, preoperative preparation, functional outcomes, complications and oncological outcomes. Careful patient selection considering absolute and relative contraindications for RARC and\/or ONB as well as the implementation of an enhanced recovery after surgery protocol is an integral part of successful oncological, functional and complication outcomes. Nerve sparing procedures in males and gynaecological organ sparing in females should be attempted in order to maximize functional outcomes. Different techniques of ICUD with ONB after RARC are described; however, all of them adhere to the principles for the functioning of an ONB. Both functional outcomes and complication rates have been improved significantly during the last few years. The current evidence for long-term outcomes following RARC shows acceptable oncological outcomes comparable to an open series including recurrence-free survival data, positive surgical margin rates and median pelvic lymph node yields.","authors":"A.

However, the choice of laparoscopic modality is largely dependent on surgeon's discretion, experience, and equipment availability. The objective of this study is: To compare outcomes between different minimally invasive approaches available for benign hysterectomies and to evaluate patient factors that influence the use of one approach over another. With this study, we sought to provide some objective criteria while deciding the appropriate MIGS technique. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study comparing perioperative outcomes between three techniques of minimally invasive hysterectomy: laparoscopy (LSC), multiport daVinci (MP-Rob) and single-site daVinci (SS-Rob). Patients undergoing benign hysterectomy (daVinci or conventional LSC) from January 2015 to July 2016 were included. 129 patients were identified and divided into: LSC (n = 44), MP-Rob (n = 36) and SS-Rob (n = 49). Results: There were statistically significant differences in age (MP-Rob46 \u2260 LSC39), body mass index (BMI) (MP-Rob33 \u2260 LSC27 or SS-Rob26.8), uterus weight (MP-Rob144 \u2260 LSC102 or SS-Rob105) and operative time (LSC192 \u2260 SS-Rob162.3 or MP-Rob163). Chi-square analyses revealed history of endometriosis and clinical endometriosis was statistically less common while leiomyomas were more common indications of MP-Rob. There was no statistically significant difference noted between length of stay, estimated blood loss, intraoperative, and post-operative complications between different surgical types. Conclusion: Patients with higher age, BMI, uterus weight and abnormal uterine bleeding were noted to undergo MP-Rob surgery. Patients with history of endometriosis were more likely to undergo LSC or SS-Rob surgery. Operative time was significantly less for daVinci hysterectomies (SS-Rob and MP-Rob) as compared to conventional LSC.","authors":"N. Gupta, DO Miranda Blevins, J.

The aim of this study is to evaluate our initial clinical experience with this novel tool. We prospectively collected all consecutive cases of local excisions of rectal lesions performed with the Flex\u00ae Robotic System performed at the Department of Surgical Sciences of the University of Turin between October 2018 and December 2019. Indications were benign, or early rectal lesions judged unsuitable for endoscopic removal, within 20 cm of the anal verge. Debriefing meetings after each procedure allowed technology assessment leading to the modification, development, and implementation of tools according to the clinical experience. We analysed the data in terms of the safety and efficacy of treatment. Between October 2018 and February 2020, 26 patients were treated. We performed a full-thickness excision in 14 patients and a submucosal dissection in 12. The median operating time was 115 min (range 45\u2013360 min). In six patients (23.1%), we converted to standard transanal endoscopic operation (TEO\u00ae) (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) to complete the procedure. The 30-day morbidity rate was 11.5% (3\/26). Positive resection margins were detected in 4 (15.4%) patients. At a minimum follow-up of 12 months, 2 (7.7%) local recurrences were observed. This first clinical series demonstrates that the Flex\u00ae Robotic System is a fascinating technology that deserves further development to increase surgical dexterity, thereby overcoming current technical limitations and improving clinical outcomes.","authors":"M.

However, a recently published randomised controlled trial (LACC trial) and an epidemiological study in the USA revealed strong evidence against the survival advantage of MIS for RH. However, the influencing factors of research centres and the learning curves of surgeons in these studies lacked sufficient evaluation. The efficacy of different surgical approaches for early-stage cervical cancer in the clinical and survival outcomes remains to be validated. Methods and analysis Patients diagnosed with FIGO (2009) stage IA1 (with lymphovascular space invasion), IA2 or IB1 cervical cancer with histological subtype of squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous carcinoma will be recruited in this multicentre randomised controlled study. Patients will be randomly assigned to undergo MIS (robot-assisted or laparoscopic RH) or abdominal RH. Within 2\u2009years, 1448 patients in 28 centres in China will be recruited to meet the criteria of a non-inferiority threshold of HR of 1.6 with bilateral nominal \u03b1 <0.05\u2009and power of 0.8.

Design: Long term follow-up in a prospective study between March 2010 to March 2016. Setting: Oncological referral center, department of gynecology and obstetrics of Alessandro Manzoni Hospital, department of gynecology, University of San Gerardo Monza, Milan. Patients: 52 patients with cervical carcinoma, matched by age, body mass index, tumor size, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, comorbidity, previous neoadjuvant chemotherapy, histology type, and tumor grade to obtain homogeneous samples. Interventions: Patients with FIGO stage IA2 or IB1 with a tumor size less than or equal to 2 cm underwent RR type B. RR-Type C1 was performed in stage IB1, with a tumor size larger than 2 cm, or in patients previously treated with NACT (IB2). In all cases Pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed for the treatment of cervical cancer. Measurements and main results: Surgical time was similar for both the 2 groups. RRH was associated with significantly less (EBL) estimated blood loss (P=0,000). Median number pelvic lymph nodes was similar, but a major number of nodes was observed in RRH group (35.58 vs 24.23; P=0,050). The overall median length of follow-up was 59 months (range: 9-92) and 30 months (range: 90-6) for RRH and TLRH group respectively. Overall survival rate (OSR) was 100% for RRH group and 83.4% for LTRH group. The DFS (disease free survival rate) was of 97% and 89% in RRH and LTRH group respectively. No significant difference was reported in HS (hospital stay). Conclusions: RRH is safe and feasible and is associated with an improved intraoperative results and clinical oncological outcomes. The present study showed that robotic surgery, in comparison to laparoscopic approach, was associated with better perioperative outcomes because of a decrease of EBL, and similar operative time, HS and complication rate, without neglecting the long-term optimal oncologic outcomes.

Data were collected from the robotic system and hospital databases. A total of 3485 robotic operations were performed. Yearly case volume nearly quadrupled. There have been 37 robotic-trained surgeons in 5 specialties performing 53 different operations. Rate of conversion to open was 4.2%. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class increased over time, with ASA class 3 increasing from 20% of patients to 45% of patients. Average case time in 2005 was 453 min, but decreased by 46% to 246 min by 2007, then remained relatively stable (range 226\u2013247). Operating efficiency improved, with room time and case time decreasing by 9% in the past 4 years. Average cost for robotic supplies was $1519 per case. Additional costs per case related to equipment and contracts totaled an average of $11,822. Average length of stay (LOS) for robotic cases was 3.3 days, compared to 3.0 days for laparoscopic and 7.0 for open. Cost per day for admission after robotic surgery was 1.7 times greater than the cost of open or laparoscopic surgery. Total admission costs of robotic operations were 1.5 times those of laparoscopic surgery, but less than open operations. Readmissions following robotic cases were lower than open (15% v 26%, p\u2009<\u20090.0001).

Perioperative outcomes were compared between the early group of surgeries performed early in the learning curve and the late group of surgeries performed after the learning curve. Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is a technically demanding and challenging procedure carrying a high morbidity. Data for RDP and RPD were prospectively collected for analysis. The learning curve was assessed by cumulative sum (CUSUM). Based on CUSUM analyses, patients were divided into the early group and the late group. There were 70 RDP and 61 RPD cases. It required 37 cases to overcome the learning curve for RDP and 20 cases for RPD. The median console time was significantly shorter in the late group for both RDP (112\u200aminutes vs 225\u200aminutes, P\u200a<\u200a.001) and RPD (360\u200aminuntes vs 520\u200aminutes, P\u200a<\u200a.001). Median blood loss was significantly less in the late group for both RDP (30 cc vs 100 cc, P\u200a=\u200a.003) and RPD (100 cc vs 200 cc, P\u200a<\u200a.001). No surgical mortality occurred in either group. Clinically relevant pancreatic fistula rate was 22.9% for RDP (32.4% in the early group vs 12.1% in the late group, P\u200a=\u200a.043), and 11.5% for RPD (0 in early group vs 17.1% in late group, P\u200a=\u200a.084). This study demonstrates that the RPD learning curve is 20 cases with prior experience of RDP and confirms the safety and feasibility of both RPD and RDP. Practice and familiarity with the robotic platform are likely to contribute to significant shortening of the learning curve in robotic pancreatic surgery, while knowledge and experience, in addition to practical skills, are also essential to minimize the potential surgical risks of RPD.","authors":"B.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of the first 30 years","abstract":"BackgroundRobotic surgery has been in existence for 30\u00a0years. This study aimed to evaluate the overall perioperative outcomes of robotic surgery compared with open surgery (OS) and conventional minimally invasive surgery (MIS) across various surgical procedures.MethodsMEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from 1990 up to October 2013 with no language restriction. Relevant review articles were hand-searched for remaining studies. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective comparative studies (PROs) on perioperative outcomes, regardless of patient age and sex, were included. Primary outcomes were blood loss, blood transfusion rate, operative time, length of hospital stay, and 30-day overall complication rate.ResultsWe identified 99 relevant articles (108 studies, 14,448 patients). For robotic versus OS, 50 studies (11 RCTs, 39 PROs) demonstrated reduction in blood loss [ratio of means (RoM) 0.505, 95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI) 0.408\u20130.602], transfusion rate [risk ratio (RR) 0.272, 95\u00a0% CI 0.165\u20130.449], length of hospital stay (RoM 0.695, 0.615\u20130.774), and 30-day overall complication rate (RR 0.637, 0.483\u20130.838) in favour of robotic surgery. For robotic versus MIS, 58 studies (21 RCTs, 37 PROs) demonstrated reduced blood loss (RoM 0.853, 0.736\u20130.969) and transfusion rate (RR 0.621, 0.390\u20130.988) in favour of robotic surgery but similar length of hospital stay (RoM 0.982, 0.936\u20131.027) and 30-day overall complication rate (RR 0.988, 0.822\u20131.188). In both comparisons, robotic surgery prolonged operative time (OS: RoM 1.073, 1.022\u20131.124; MIS: RoM 1.135, 1.096\u20131.173). The benefits of robotic surgery lacked robustness on RCT-sensitivity analyses. However, many studies, including the relatively few available RCTs, suffered from high risk of bias and inadequate statistical power.ConclusionsOur results showed that robotic surgery contributed positively to some perioperative outcomes but longer operative times remained a shortcoming.

The patients all had a diagnosis of middle and low rectal adenocarcinoma with stage\u2005I-III disease. The median follow-up period was 37.4 mo. Perioperative results, morbidity a pathological data were evaluated and compared. The 3-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were calculated and compared.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients were comparable in terms of preoperative and demographic parameters. The median surgery time was 192 min for laparoscopic TME (L-TME) and 342 min for robotic TME (R-TME) (P < 0.001). There were no differences found in the rates of conversion to open surgery and morbidity. The patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery stayed in the hospital two days longer than the robotic group patients (8 d for L-TME and 6 d for R-TME, P < 0.001). The pathologic evaluation showed a higher number of harvested lymph nodes in the robotic group (18 for R-TME, 11 for L-TME, P < 0.001) and a shorter distal resection margin for laparoscopic patients (1.5 cm for L-TME, 2.5 cm for R-TME, P < 0.001).

The purpose of this systematic overview was to summarize the findings of the most recent meta-analyses that compare clinical and surgical outcomes of robot-assisted versus conventional THA. Two readers independently conducted an electronic literature search, screening and data extraction from five electronic databases. Inclusion criteria were: meta-analyses evaluating robot-assisted versus conventional THA in terms of radiographic outcomes, clinical and functional scores, and complications and revision rates. The literature search returned 67 records, of which 14 were duplicates and 49 were excluded, leaving three meta-analyses published within the past two years for data extraction and analysis. The present overview of meta-analyses suggests that, compared to conventional THA (n = 3011), robot-assisted THA (n = 1813) improves component placement and reduces intraoperative complications. The overview also affirms that robot-assisted THA could extend surgery by 20 minutes, and increases risks of postoperative heterotopic ossification, dislocation, and revision. None of the meta-analyses found significant differences in clinical or functional scores between robot-assisted and conventional THA. Future studies and reviews should make a clear distinction between active and semi-active robotic assistance, address technology matureness, and describe the experience of surgeons with robotic assistance.

These innovations supply real-time, three-dimensional imaging information to aid in instrumentation, decompression, and implant placement. Although nothing can replace the knowledge and expertise of an experienced spine surgeon, these platforms do have the potential to supplement the individual surgeon's capabilities. Specific advantages include more precise pedicle screw placement, minimally invasive surgery with less reliance on intraoperative fluoroscopy, and lower radiation exposure to the surgeon and staff. As these technologies have become more widely adopted over the years, novel uses such as tumor resection have been explored. Disadvantages include the cost of implementing IG and robotics platforms, the initial learning curve for both the surgeon and the staff, and increased patient radiation exposure in scoliosis surgery. Also, given the relatively recent transition of many procedures from inpatient settings to ambulatory surgery centers, access to current devices may be cost prohibitive and not as readily available at some centers. Regarding patient-related outcomes, much further research is warranted. The short-term benefits of minimally invasive surgery often bolster the perioperative and early postoperative outcomes in many retrospective studies on IG and RA surgery. Randomized controlled trials limiting such confounding factors are warranted to definitively show potential independent improvements in patient-related outcomes specifically attributable to IG and RA alone. Nonetheless, irrespective of these current unknowns, it is clear that these technologies have changed the field and the practice of spine surgery. Surgeons should be familiar with the potential benefits and tradeoffs of these platforms when considering adopting IG and robotics in their practices.","authors":"David H.

Endovascular robotic technology may help overcome many of the challenges associated with traditional endovascular techniques by enabling greater control, stability, and precision of target navigation and treatment, while simultaneously reducing operator learning curves and improving safety. Several robotic systems have been developed to perform a broad range of endovascular procedures, but none have been used at scale or widely in routine practice, and the evidence for their safety, effectiveness, and efficiency remains limited. High cost and device complexity, lack of haptic feedback, and limited integration and interoperability with existing equipment and devices are the principal technology, cost, and sustainability barriers to the scalability and widespread adoption in day-to-day practice. In order to fully realize its potential, future robotic innovation must ensure compatibility with a range of off-the-shelf equipment that can be tracked and exchanged quickly during a procedure and come together with developments in navigation, tracking, and imaging. Reducing cost and complexity and supporting sustainability of the technology is key. In parallel, new technologies must be evaluated by clear and transparent standardized outcomes and be accompanied by robust clinical training. Key to the successful future development and dissemination of robotic technology is open collaboration among industry, clinicians, and patients in order to fully understand and address current challenges and enable the technology to realize its full potential.","authors":"L.

Thereby, the transformation away from an experience-based to a data-based more patient-specific treatment is the basis for an extensive analysis of various parameters and its interpretation regarding their relevance during the treatment pathway. In different fields of daily life, artificial intelligence (AI) and, especially, machine learning (ML) have shown to use, analyse, and interpret enormous amount of data and based on intelligent algorithms to improve finally quality along the process. Machine learning represents a distinct application of AI, which describes algorithms for automatic and incremental function optimization. This can be used to make predictions by detecting non-linear relationships in large data sets [5]. Both offer tremendous new possibilities and clearly are promising options for the field of orthopaedic surgery, and in particular for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Here, patients were treated in a standardized manner over long periods of time with the goal of achieving the same alignment while neglecting individual or personal variations in alignment and morphology variations [3]. While the goal was always the same, the individual knees and especially the alignment and shape were not. From today's perspective, you do not have to be a rocket scientist to understand that due to the variability of anatomy, personalized targeting is the future. Therefore, many knee surgeons strive to personalize their alignment goals, but without knowing the consequences of the changes made. The safe transition from a purely standard mechanical alignment to a more personalized alignment might be a rocky road [13]. To make the road a less rocky or paved one, it is of utmost importance to have support from state-of-theart data analysis tools to answer pertinent questions such as [12]: which is the best alignment goal for which phenotype? What are the phenotypic clinical and functional outcomes after different types of personalized alignment strategies? Finally, having a tool supporting orthopaedic surgeons before any therapy is initiated, giving them the information, which treatment option or alignment strategy might be the most promising for a specific patient, would hopefully help to minimize the rate of the reported 20% unhappy patients after TKA. Moreover, the effect of further outcome-relevant parameters such as patient expectation, BMI, or compliance can be calculated and provide insight into their potential non-linear relation. Over the past decades, TKA surgery has strived for more and more precision to achieve a standard goal that is the same for all patients. In recent years, however, it was realised that our patient population not only implicates a wide variety of individual preoperative factors (e.g., activity levels, mental status, knee pathologies), but also various different anatomical knee parameters (bone morphology, ligamentous and soft-tissue morphology) [1, 2, 6, 7, 9]. This variation, which has not yet been fully understood, has recently led to a more individualized approach to treatment. However, the sheer quantity and interplay of parameters makes it difficult to understand which factor has which influence on which part of the result. Such complex analysis can only be performed with the help of AI and ML. Until now, only a few studies have been published using ML for prediction of complications, costs and outcome. The majority of these studies failed to show a potential of ML in TKA surgery [5].

The overall objective of anaesthesia is to minimize perioperative risk and discomfort for patients both during and after surgery. Anaesthesia for patients undergoing robotic assisted surgery is different from anaesthesia for patients undergoing open or laparoscopic surgery; new anaesthetic concerns accompany robotic assisted surgery.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess outcomes related to the choice of total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) or inhalational anaesthesia for adults undergoing transabdominal robotic assisted laparoscopic gynaecological, urological or gastroenterological surgery.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016 Issue 5), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to May 2016), Embase via OvidSP (1982 to May 2016), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) via EBSCOhost (1982 to May 2016) and the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science (1956 to May 2016). We also searched the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) Registry and Clinical trials gov for ongoing trials (May 2016).\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including adults, aged 18 years and older, of both genders, treated with transabdominal robotic assisted laparoscopic gynaecological, urological or gastroenterological surgery and focusing on outcomes of TIVA or inhalational anaesthesia.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nWe used standard methodological procedures of Cochrane. Study findings were not suitable for meta-analysis.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included three single-centre, two-arm RCTs involving 170 participants. We found one ongoing trial. All included participants were male and were undergoing radical robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP). The men were between 50 and 75 years of age and met criteria for American Society of Anesthesiologists physical classification scores (ASA) I, ll and III.We found evidence showing no clinically meaningful differences in postoperative pain between the two types of anaesthetics (mean difference (MD) in visual analogue scale (VAS) scores at one to six hours was -2.20 (95% confidence interval (CI) -10.62 to 6.22; P = 0.61) in a sample of 62 participants from one study. Low-quality evidence suggests that propofol reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) over the short term (one to six hours after surgery) after RALRP compared with inhalational anaesthesia (sevoflurane, desflurane) (MD -1.70, 95% CI -2.59 to -0.81; P = 0.0002).We found low-quality evidence suggesting that propofol may prevent an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) after pneumoperitoneum and steep Trendelenburg positioning compared with sevoflurane (MD -3.90, 95% CI -6.34 to -1.46; P = 0.002) with increased IOP from baseline to 30 minutes in steep Trendelenburg. However, it is unclear whether this surrogate outcome translates directly to clinical avoidance of ocular complications during surgery. No studies addressed the secondary outcomes of adverse effects, all-cause mortality, respiratory or circulatory complications, cognitive dysfunction, length of stay or costs. Overall the quality of evidence was low to very low, as all studies were small, single-centre trials providing unclear descriptions of methods.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nIt is unclear which anaesthetic technique is superior - TIVA or inhalational - for transabdominal robotic assisted surgery in urology, gynaecology and gastroenterology, as existing evidence is scarce, is of low quality and has been generated from exclusively male patients undergoing robotic radical prostatectomy.An ongoing trial, which includes participants of both genders with a focus on quality of recovery, might have an impact on future evidence related to this topic.","authors":"S.

The use of the robotic platform for complex pancreatic resections, such as the pancreaticoduodenectomy, requires close monitoring of outcomes during its implementation phase to ensure patient safety is maintained and the learning curve identified.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo report the results of a quality analysis and learning curve during the implementation of robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy (RPD).\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nA retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of 200 consecutive patients who underwent RPD in a large academic center from October 3, 2008, through March 1, 2014, was evaluated for important metrics of quality. Patients were analyzed in groups of 20 to minimize demographic differences and optimize the ability to detect statistically meaningful changes in performance.\n\n\nEXPOSURES\nRobotic pancreaticoduodenectomy.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nOptimization of perioperative outcome parameters.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo statistical differences in mortality rates or major morbidity were noted during the study. Statistical improvements in estimated blood loss and conversions to open surgery occurred after 20 cases (600 mL vs 250 mL [P\u2009=\u2009.002] and 35.0% vs 3.3% [P\u2009<\u2009.001], respectively), incidence of pancreatic fistula after 40 cases (27.5% vs 14.4%; P = .04), and operative time after 80 cases (581 minutes vs 417 minutes [P\u2009<\u2009.001]). Complication rates, lengths of stay, and readmission rates showed continuous improvement that did not reach statistical significance. Outcomes for the last 120 cases (representing optimized metrics beyond the learning curve) included a mean operative time of 417 minutes, median estimated blood loss of 250 mL, a conversion rate of 3.3%, 90-day mortality of 3.3%, a clinically significant (grade B\/C) pancreatic fistula rate of 6.9%, and a median length of stay of 9 days.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nContinuous assessment of quality metrics allows for safe implementation of RPD. We identified several inflexion points corresponding to optimization of performance metrics for RPD that can be used as benchmarks for surgeons who are adopting this technology.","authors":"B.

Ever since laparoscopic surgery was first applied to TME for rectal cancer, with increasing penetration rates, especially in Asia, an unstable camera platform, the limited mobility of straight laparoscopic instruments, the two-dimensional imaging, and a poor ergonomic position for surgeons have been regarded as limitations. Robotic technology was developed in an attempt to reduce the limitations of laparoscopic surgery. The robotic system has many advantages, including a more ergonomic position, stable camera platform and stereoscopic view, as well as elimination of tremor and subsequent improved dexterity. Current comparison data between robotic and laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery show similar intraoperative results and morbidity, postoperative recovery, and short-term oncologic outcomes. Potential benefits of a robotic system include reduction of surgeon's fatigue during surgery, improved performance and safety for intracorporeal suture, reduction of postoperative complications, sharper and more meticulous dissection, and completion of autonomic nerve preservation techniques. However, the higher cost for a robotic system still remains an obstacle to wide application, and many socioeconomic issues remain to be solved in the future. In addition, we need more concrete evidence regarding the merits for both patients and surgeons, as well as the merits compared to conventional laparoscopic techniques. Therefore, we need large-scale prospective randomized clinical trials to prove the potential benefits of robot TME for the treatment of rectal cancer.","authors":"N.

The prompt accurate assessment of surgical skill remains a challenge, in part, because expert faculty reviewers are often unavailable. By harnessing the power of large readily available crowds through the Internet, rapid, accurate, and low-cost assessments may be achieved. We hypothesized that assessments provided by crowd workers highly correlate with expert surgeons' assessments.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA group of 49 surgeons from two hospitals performed two dry-laboratory robotic surgical skill assessment tasks. The performance of these tasks was video recorded and posted online for evaluation using Amazon Mechanical Turk. The surgical tasks in each video were graded by (n=30) varying crowd workers and (n=3) experts using a modified global evaluative assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS) grading tool, and the mean scores were compared using Cronbach's alpha statistic.\n\n\nRESULTS\nGEARS evaluations from the crowd were obtained for each video and task and compared with the GEARS ratings from the expert surgeons. The crowd-based performance scores agreed with the performance assessments by experts with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.84 and 0.92 for the two tasks, respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe assessment of surgical skill by crowd workers resulted in a high degree of agreement with the scores provided by expert surgeons in the evaluation of basic robotic surgical dry-laboratory tasks. Crowd responses cost less and were much faster to acquire. This study provides evidence that crowds may provide an adjunctive method for rapidly providing feedback of skills to training and practicing surgeons.","authors":"Lee W. White, Timothy M.

Methods Patients with clinical stage T1\u2013T2, N0\u2013N1 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were randomly assigned to robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS) or video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) resection arms. The primary objective was the incidence of adverse events including complications and conversion to thoracotomy. The secondary objectives included extent of lymph node (LN) dissection and other indicators. Results This trial was closed at 83 cases as the probability of concluding in favor of the robot arm for the primary outcome was null according to the observed trend. In this study, we report the results of the analysis conducted on the patients enrolled until trial suspension. Thirty-nine cases were randomized in the VATS arm and 38 in the robotic arm. Six patients were excluded from analysis. Despite finding no difference between the two arms in perioperative complications, conversions, duration of surgery, or duration of postoperative stay, a significantly greater degree of LN assessment by the robotic technique was observed in regards to the median number of sampled LN stations [6, interquartile range (IQR) 4\u20136 vs. 4, IQR 3\u20135; p = 0.0002], hilar LNs (7, IQR 5\u201310 vs. 4, IQR 2\u20137; p = 0.0003), and mediastinal LNs (7, IQR 5\u201310 vs. 5, IQR 3\u20137; p = 0.0001). Conclusions The results of this trial demonstrated that RATS was not superior to VATS considering the perioperative outcome for early-stage NSCLC, but the robotic approach allowed an improvement of LN dissection.

Background: Lymphaticovenous anastomosis, a supermicrosurgical technique, creates bypasses between the lymphatic and venous systems. The quality of lymphaticovenous anastomosis depends on the surgeon\u2019s dexterity and precision, and is subject to imperfections caused by the physiologic tremor of the human hand. A dedicated robot for microsurgery has been created to overcome these limitations (MUSA, MicroSure, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). This study describes 1-year clinical outcomes of the first-in-human trial of robot-assisted and manual lymphaticovenous anastomosis in patients with breast cancer\u2013related lymphedema. Methods: In this prospective pilot study, women with breast cancer\u2013related lymphedema were randomized into the robot-assisted or manual lymphaticovenous anastomosis group. Outcomes were quality of life, arm circumference, conservative treatment frequency, arm dermal backflow stage, and anastomosis patency. Results: Twenty women were included, of whom eight underwent robot-assisted lymphaticovenous anastomosis surgery and 12 underwent manual surgery. In both groups, quality of life significantly improved at 12 months (robot-assisted surgery, p = 0.045; manual surgery, p = 0.001). Arm circumference did not decrease (robot-assisted surgery, p = 0.094; manual surgery, p = 0.240). Daily use of compression garments decreased by 61.9 percent (robot-assisted surgery) and 70.2 percent (manual surgery). The frequency of manual lymphatic drainage remained similar compared with baseline. Arm dermal backflow stage was reduced in one patient in the robot-assisted group and in five cases in the manual group. Overall, 76.5 percent of the anastomoses were patent (robot-assisted surgery, 66.6 percent; manual surgery, 81.8 percent). Conclusions: After evaluating 1-year follow-up data, this study confirms the feasibility of robot-assisted lymphaticovenous anastomosis surgery. Clinical outcomes were comparable between robot-assisted and manual lymphaticovenous anastomosis. This encourages further research using the new microsurgical robot MUSA for lymphaticovenous anastomosis and other (super)microsurgical procedures.

Despite encouraging results from selected centres, there is a paucity of robust clinical data to establish its clinical safety and efficacy. The present systematic review aimed to identify all relevant clinical data on robotic CABG. The primary endpoint was perioperative mortality, and secondary endpoints included perioperative morbidities, anastomotic complications, and long-term survival.\n\n\nMETHODS\nElectronic searches were performed using three online databases from their dates of inception to 2016. Relevant studies fulfilling the predefined search criteria were categorized according to surgical techniques as (I) totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass without cardiopulmonary bypass (TECAB off-pump); (II) TECAB on-pump; and robotic-assisted mammary artery harvesting followed by minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (robotic MIDCAB).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe present systematic review identified 44 studies that fulfilled the study selection criteria, including nine studies in the TECAB off-pump group and 16 studies in the robotic MIDCAB group. Statistical analysis reported a pooled mortality of 1.7% for the TECAB off-pump group and 1.0% for the robotic MIDCAB group. Intraoperative details such as the number and location of grafts performed, operative times and conversion rates, as well as postoperative secondary endpoints such as morbidities, anastomotic complications and long-term outcomes were also summarized for both techniques.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA number of technical, logistic and cost-related issues continue to hinder the popularization of the robotic CABG procedure. Current clinical evidence is limited by a lack of randomized controlled trials, heterogeneous definition of techniques and complications, as well as a lack of robust clinical follow-up with routine angiography. Nonetheless, the present systematic review reported acceptable perioperative mortality rates for selected patients at specialized centres. These results should be considered as a useful benchmark for future studies, until further data is reported in the form of randomized trials.","authors":"C. Cao, P. Indraratna, M. Doyle, D. Tian, K.

Our hospital started using TORS with the approval of the Ethical Review Board and the Minimum Invasive Surgical Center Committee at Tottori University. No surgical outcomes of TORS for Japanese patients with head and neck cancer have been reported in Japan.

Objective To compare the accuracy and short-term clinical outcomes of pedicle screw placement between robot-assisted (RA) and freehand (FH) technique in the treatment of adult degenerative scoliosis (ADS). Methods From February 2018 to October 2019, 97 adult patients with degenerative scoliosis admitted to our department were retrospectively reviewed. Thirty-one patients received robot-assisted pedicle screw placement (RA group), and 66 patients underwent freehand pedicle screw placement (FH group). Patient demographics and short-term clinical outcomes were recorded and compared between two groups. Gertzbein-Robbins grading system was adopted to evaluate the accuracy of pedicle screw placement by means of postoperative CT scan. Short-term clinical outcomes consist of operative time, intraoperative blood loss, length of hospital stay (LOS), radiological parameters, Scoliosis Research Society-22 (SRS-22) scores before the operation, 6\u2009months after operation, adverse events, and revisions. Results The accuracy of screw placement was higher than that of the FH group (clinically acceptable 98.7% vs. 92.2%; P < 0.001). Intraoperative blood loss of the RA group was less than those in the FH group (499 vs. 573\u2009ml; P < 0.001). Operative time (283.1 vs. 291.9\u2009min; P = 0.31) and length of stay (12.8 vs. 13.7 days; P = 0.36) were compared between RA and FH groups. In terms of radiological parameters, both of groups were improved postoperatively. The SRS-22 scores at 6\u2009months after operation from both groups were better than those before operation. For surgery-related complication, one case had pressure sores in the RA group while two cases developed dural tears in the FH group. No revision was required in both groups. Conclusion Combined with other surgical correction modalities, robot-assisted pedicle screw fixation is an effective and safe method of treating degenerative scoliosis.

Correspondingly, robotic gastroscopes with advanced functionalities, e.g., disposable, dextrous and not invasive solutions, have been developed in the last years. This article extensively reviews these novel devices and describes their functionalities and performance. In addition, the implementation of artificial intelligence technology into robotic gastroscopes, combined with remote telehealth endoscopy services, are discussed. The aim of this paper is to provide a clear and comprehensive view of contemporary robotic gastroscopes and ancillary technologies to support medical practitioners in their future clinical practice but also to inspire and drive new engineering developments. Abstract Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract pathology is common worldwide. With recent advancements in robotics, innovative diagnostic and treatment devices have been developed and several translational attempts made. This review paper aims to provide a highly pictorial critical review of robotic gastroscopes, so that clinicians and researchers can obtain a swift and comprehensive overview of key technologies and challenges. Therefore, the paper presents robotic gastroscopes, either commercial or at a progressed technology readiness level. Among them, we show tethered and wireless gastroscopes, as well as devices aimed for UGI surgery. The technological features of these instruments, as well as their clinical adoption and performance, are described and compared. Although the existing endoscopic devices have thus far provided substantial improvements in the effectiveness of diagnosis and treatment, there are certain aspects that represent unwavering predicaments of the current gastroenterology practice. A detailed list includes difficulties and risks, such as transmission of communicable diseases (e.g., COVID-19) due to the doctor\u2013patient proximity, unchanged learning curves, variable detection rates, procedure-related adverse events, endoscopists\u2019 and nurses\u2019 burnouts, limited human and\/or material resources, and patients\u2019 preferences to choose non-invasive options that further interfere with the successful implementation and adoption of routine screening. The combination of robotics and artificial intelligence, as well as remote telehealth endoscopy services, are also discussed, as viable solutions to improve existing platforms for diagnosis and treatment are emerging.","authors":"W.

For this reason, we aimed to define the added value of SNB (with different tracer modalities) to ePLND in the identification of nodal metastases. Complication rates and oncologic outcomes were also assessed. Methods: From January 2006 to December 2019, prospectively collected data were retrospectively analyzed from a single-institution database regarding prostate cancer patients treated with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and ePLND with or without additional use of SNB, either with the hybrid tracer indocyanine green (ICG)\u201399mTc-nanocolloid or with free ICG. Multivariable logistic and Cox regression models tested the impact of adding SNB (either with the hybrid tracer or with free ICG) on lymph nodal invasion detection, complications, and oncologic outcomes. Results: Overall, 1,680 patients were included in the final analysis: 1,168 (69.5%) in the non-SNB group, 161 (9.6%) in the ICG-SNB group, and 351 (20.9%) in the hybrid-SNB group. The hybrid-SNB group (odds ratio, 1.61; 95%CI, 1.18\u20132.20; P = 0.002) was an independent predictor of nodal involvement, whereas the ICG-SNB group did not reach independent predictor status when compared with the non-SNB group (odds ratio, 1.35; 95%CI, 0.89\u20132.03; P = 0.1). SNB techniques were not associated with higher rates of complications. Lastly, use of hybrid SNB was associated with lower rates of biochemical recurrence (0.79; 95%CI, 0.63\u20130.98) and of clinical recurrence (hazard ratio, 0.76, P = 0.035) than were seen in the non-SNB group.

We retrospectively reviewed information from our multi-institutional database. Every patient over 75 years old who underwent a PN between 2003 and 2016 was included. Peri-operative and follow up data were collected. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine independent predictive factors of postoperative complications. We reviewed 191 procedures including 69 (40%) open-surgery, and 122 (60%) laparoscopic procedures, of which 105 were robot-assisted. Median follow-up was 25 months. The mean age was 78 [75\u201388]. The American Society of Anesthesiologist\u2019s score was 1, 2, 3 and 4 in 10.5%, 60%, 29% and 0.5% of patients respectively. The mean tumor size was 4.6 cm. Indication of PN was elective in 122 (65%) patients and imperative in 52 patients (28%). The median length of surgery was 150(\u00b1\u200960) minutes, and the median estimated blood loss 200 ml. The mean glomerular filtration rate was 71.5 ml\/minute preoperatively, and 62 ml\/min three months after surgery. The severe complications (Clavien III-V) rate was 6.2%. On multivariate analysis, the robotic-assisted procedure was an independent protective factor of medical postoperative complications (Odds Ration (OR)\u2009=\u20090.31 [0.12\u20130.80], p\u2009=\u20090.01).

Methods This was an international, multicentre, prospective, observational, monitored, non-randomized, parallel, four-cohort study (laparoscopic ECA; laparoscopic ICA; robot-assisted ECA; robot-assisted ICA). High-volume surgeons (at least 30 minimally invasive right colectomy procedures\/year) from 59 hospitals across 12 European countries treated patients over a 3-year interval The primary composite endpoint was 30-day success, defined by two measures of efficacy\u2014absence of surgical wound infection and of any major complication within the first 30 days after surgery. Secondary outcomes were: overall complications, conversion rate, duration of operation, and number of lymph nodes harvested. Propensity score analysis was used for comparison of ICA with ECA, and robot-assisted surgery with laparoscopy. Results Some 1320 patients were included in an intention-to-treat analysis (laparoscopic ECA, 555; laparoscopic ICA, 356; robot-assisted ECA, 88; robot-assisted ICA, 321). No differences in the co-primary endpoint at 30 days after surgery were observed between cohorts (7.2 and 7.6 per cent in ECA and ICA groups respectively; 7.8 and 6.6 per cent in laparoscopic and robot-assisted groups).

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is a technology that combines the use of second-generation contrast agents consisting of microbubbles with existent ultrasound techniques. Until now, this novel technology has aided surgeons with procedures involving the liver. However, with recent advances in the CEUS technique and the introduction of robotics in nephron-sparing surgery, CEUS has proven to be efficacious in answering several clinical questions with respect to the kidneys. In addition, the introduction of the microbubble-based contrast agents has increased the image quality and signal uptake by the ultrasound probe. This has led to better, enhanced scanning of the macro and microvasculature of the kidneys, making CEUS a powerful diagnostic modality. This imaging method is capable of further lowering the learning curve and warm ischemia time (WIT) during robotic-assisted nephron-sparing surgery, with its increased level of capillary perfusion and imaging. CEUS has the potential to increase the sensitivity and specificity of intra-operative images, and can significantly improve the outcome of robotic-assisted nephron-sparing surgery by increasing the precision and diagnostic insight of the surgeon. The purpose of this article is to review the practical and potential uses of CEUS as an intra-operative imaging technique during robotic-assisted nephron-sparing surgery.","authors":"A. Alenezi, O.

Minimally invasive robotic surgery is becoming more popular in the field of urogynecology. Herein, we present the safety and efficacy of a large case series of robotic-assisted Burch urethropexy. A retrospective chart review was performed on robotic-assisted Burch urethropexy cases performed between 2013 and 2019. Patient characteristics, perioperative data and follow-up outcomes were collected at a single teaching institution. A total of 76 women underwent robotic-assisted Burch urethropexy for pure stress urinary incontinence. Fifty of them had concomitant robotic procedures at the time of the Burch. We performed the robotic-assisted Burch urethropexy alone on 26 patients. The mean age was 55\u2009years old. The overall treatment success rate was 85% with a mean follow-up time of 134 (\u00b1157.8) days. Complications included cystotomy (3%), urinary tract infection (16%) and postoperative voiding dysfunction (10%). Our study reveals that robotic-assisted Burch urethropexy is a feasible option in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence in terms of operative outcomes and short-term efficacy. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? Minimally invasive robotic surgery is becoming more popular in the field of urogynecology. Surgical repairs for stress urinary incontinence will likely increase in the coming years secondary to an aging population. Burch urethropexy is one of the earliest and most effective surgeries for stress urinary incontinence and can be performed abdominally, laparoscopically and now, using robotic assistance. What do the results of this study add? This study reveals that robotic-assisted Burch urethropexy is a feasible option in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence in terms of intraoperative outcomes with good short-term efficacy. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and\/or further research? Lately, interest in colposuspension procedures has been rekindled as physicians seek alternative stress urinary incontinence treatment options. Robotic-assisted Burch urethropexy will continue to gain popularity with its efficacy and safety.","authors":"Toy G Lee, B. S. Unlu, V. Petruzzi, Mostafa A Borahay, F. Dursun, Antonio F. Saad, G.

We evaluated the clinical benefits of robot-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE) in comparison with the conventional open esophageal surgery. From 2012 to 2016, 371 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma underwent an Ivor Lewis or McKeown procedure at our institution. Of these, 130 patients underwent laparoscopic gastric conduit formation followed by RAMIE, whereas 241 patients underwent conventional esophageal surgery, including laparotomy and open esophagectomy (OE). We compared the short- and long-term clinical outcomes of these patients using the propensity score-based inverse probability of treatment weighting technique (IPTW). Among the early outcomes, the OE group showed a higher incidence of pneumonia (P\u2009=\u20090.035) and a higher requirement for vasopressors (P\u2009=\u20090.001). Regarding the long-term outcomes, all-cause mortality was significantly higher (P\u2009=\u20090.001) and disease-free survival was lower (P\u2009=\u20090.006) in the OE group. Wound-related problems also occurred more frequently in the OE group (P\u2009=\u20090.020) during the long-term follow-up. There was no statistical intergroup difference in the recurrence rates (P\u2009=\u20090.191). The Cox proportional-hazard analysis demonstrated that wound problems (HR 0.16, 95% CI 0.02-0.57; P\u2009=\u20090.017), pneumonia (HR 0.23, 95% CI 0.06-0.68; P\u2009=\u20090.019), and use of vasopressors (HR 0.14, 95% CI 0.08-0.25; P\u2009=\u20090.001) were independent predictors of mortality.

Advances in algorithmic science and increased understanding of operational considerations in AI deployment are opening the door to widespread clinical pathway transformation. For surgery in particular, the application of machine learning algorithms in fields such as computer vision and operative robotics are poised to radically change how we screen, diagnose, risk-stratify, treat and follow-up patients, in both pre- and post-operative stages, and within operating theatres. Summary In this paper, we summarise the current landscape of existing and emerging integrations within complex surgical care pathways. We investigate effective methods for practical use of AI throughout the patient pathway, from early screening and accurate diagnosis to intraoperative robotics, post-operative monitoring and follow-up. Horizon scanning of AI technologies in surgery is used to identify novel innovations that can enhance surgical practice today, with potential for paradigm shifts across core domains of surgical practice in the future. Any AI-driven future must be built on responsible and ethical usage, reinforced by effective oversight of data governance, and of risks to patient safety in deployment. Implementation is additionally bound to considerations of usability and pathway feasibility, and the need for robust healthcare technology assessment and evidence generation. While these factors are traditionally seen as barriers to translating AI into practice, we discuss how holistic implementation practices can create a solid foundation for scaling AI across pathways. Key Messages The next decade will see rapid translation of experimental development into real-world impact. AI will require evolution of work practices, but will also enhance patient safety, enhance surgical quality outcomes, and provide significant value for surgeons and health systems. Surgical practice has always sat on a bedrock of technological innovation. For those that follow this tradition, the future of AI in surgery starts now.","authors":"Ahmad Guni, Piyush Varma, Joe Zhang, M. Fehervari, H.

Although they differ greatly in terms of prognosis, hypopharyngeal cancers are usually treated together with laryngeal cancers in clinical trials. Therefore, there are very few studies that focus specifically on patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma. As a result, the therapeutic management of these patients is highly debated, and their clinical outcomes are poorly reported. The aim of this review is therefore to discuss the current therapeutic options in patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma and their oncologic and functional outcomes. Patients with early-stage tumors can be treated either by conservative surgery (including transoral robot-assisted surgery) or by RT alone. However, most patients are diagnosed with locally advanced tumors that cannot be treated surgically without total laryngectomy. In this situation, the critical issue is to select the patients eligible for a larynx preservation therapeutic program. However, radical surgery with total laryngectomy still plays an important role in the management of patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma, either as the primary treatment modality (T4 resectable primary tumor, contraindication to larynx preservation therapies) or, more commonly, as salvage treatment.","authors":"A.

In addition, there are very few data about the impact of robot-guided fusion on patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Thus, the clinical benefit for the patient is unclear. In this study, the authors analyzed revision rates for screw malposition and changes in PROs following minimally invasive robot-guided pedicle screw fixation. METHODS A retrospective cohort study of patients who had undergone minimally invasive posterior lumbar interbody fusion (MI-PLIF) or minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion was performed. Patients were followed up clinically at 6 weeks, 12 months, and 24 months after treatment and by mailed questionnaire in March 2016 as a final follow-up. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores for back and leg pain severity, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), screw revisions, and socio-demographic factors were analyzed. A literature review was performed, comparing the incidence of intraoperative screw revisions and revision surgery for screw malposition in robot-guided, navigated, and freehand fusion procedures. RESULTS Seventy-two patients fit the study inclusion criteria and had a mean follow up of 32 \u00b1 17 months. No screws had to be revised intraoperatively, and no revision surgery for screw malposition was needed. In the literature review, the authors found a higher rate of intraoperative screw revisions in the navigated pool than in the robot-guided pool (p < 0.001, OR 9.7). Additionally, a higher incidence of revision surgery for screw malposition was observed for freehand procedures than for the robot-guided procedures (p < 0.001, OR 8.1). The VAS score for back pain improved significantly from 66.9 \u00b1 25.0 preoperatively to 30.1 \u00b1 26.8 at the final follow-up, as did the VAS score for leg pain (from 70.6 \u00b1 22.8 to 24.3 \u00b1 28.3) and ODI (from 43.4 \u00b1 18.3 to 16.2 \u00b1 16.7; all p < 0.001). Undergoing PLIF, a high body mass index, smoking status, and a preoperative ability to work were identified as predictors of a reduction in back pain. Length of hospital stay was 2.4 \u00b1 1.1 days and operating time was 161 \u00b1 50 minutes. Ability to work increased from 38.9% to 78.2% of patients (p < 0.001) at the final follow-up, and 89.1% of patients indicated they would choose to undergo the same treatment again. CONCLUSIONS In adults with low-grade spondylolisthesis, the data demonstrated a benefit in using robotic guidance to reduce the rate of revision surgery for screw malposition as compared with other techniques of pedicle screw insertion described in peer-reviewed publications. Larger comparative studies are required to assess differences in PROs following a minimally invasive approach in spinal fusion surgeries compared with other techniques.","authors":"M.

Methods We retrospectively reviewed our patients undergoing robotic cardiac reoperation (redo group) from July 2013 to April 2017 at our institution and compared with our patients undergoing standard robotic surgery (nonredo group). In the reoperative cases, a thoracoscope was inserted through a 5-mm port placed away from the previous scar. Another 5-mm port was inserted under direct vision to make space for one or two robotic arms, and further precise dissection was performed robotically. Results A total of 486 patients underwent robotic-assisted cardiac surgery. There were 36 patients who had one or more previous cardiac surgeries (42 surgeries). Although the mean operative and cardiopulmonary bypass time were longer in the redo group (median = 351 minutes vs. 289 minutes and 219 minutes vs. 178 minutes, P < 0.05, respectively), cardiac arrest time was similar between two groups. The redo group had a higher incidence of postoperative prolonged ventilation (16.7% vs. 6.9%, P = 0.046) and pneumonia (11.1% vs. 0.2%, P < 0.001). The 30-day mortality was 2.8% (1\/36) in the redo group and similar to that in the nonredo group (1.3%, P = 0.419). Conclusions Robotic cardiac reoperation is feasible with acceptable clinical outcomes including a low mortality rate similar to standard robotic surgery in our hands. Robotic assistance may have the potential to minimize morbidity and mortality.","authors":"H. Kitahara, B. Wehman, H.

Methods: A questionnaire was designed to discern the attitude of orthopaedic consultants and residents to the technical challenges of performing knee arthroscopy and the possible role of robotically enhanced surgery. The questionnaire included 31 questions across five key domains. Results: Iatrogenic damage to articular cartilage was thought to occur in at least 1 in 10 cases by 50% of respondents with 15% believing that it occurred in every case. One hundred or more procedures were thought to be necessary to overcome the learning curve by 40% of respondents and 77.5% believed that 50 procedures or above were necessary. Ninety-nine per cent of respondents agreed that higher technical skills would decrease unintended damage. Despite such difficulties with the procedure and no prior experience with robotic surgery, 47% of respondents see a role for semiautonomous arthroscopic systems in the future. Conclusions: Surgeons believe that knee arthroscopy is a difficult procedure with a long learning curve and a high incidence of iatrogenic cartilage damage. Many find it ergonomically challenging and have frustration with current tools and technology. Clinical Relevance: This is the first study that highlights surgeons\u2019 difficulties performing knee arthroscopy despite the commonly held attitudes that it is a straightforward procedure. Systems that are able to decrease these problems should improve patients\u2019 outcomes and decrease the risk of harm.","authors":"A. Jaiprakash, W. O\u2019Callaghan, S. Whitehouse, A.

Robotic-assisted pyeloplasty (RALP) is now considered a new gold standard in pediatric MIS. A systematic review of the literature retrieved from PubMed and published in the last 10 years (2012\u20132022) was performed. This review underlines that in all children except the smallest infants, where the open procedure has benefits in terms of duration of general anesthetic and there are limitations in the size of instruments, robotic pyeloplasty is becoming the preferred procedure to perform in patients with UPJO. Results for the robotic approach are extremely promising, with shorter operative times than laparoscopy and equal success rates, length of stay and complications. In case of redo pyeloplasty, RALP is easier to perform than other open or MIS procedures. By 2009, robotic surgery became the most used modality to treat all UPJO and continues to grow in popularity. Robot-assisted laparoscopic pyeloplasty in children is safe and effective with excellent outcomes, even in redo pyeloplasty or challenging anatomical cases. Moreover, robotic approach shortens the learning curve for junior surgeons, who can readily achieve levels of expertise comparable to senior practitioners. However, there are still concerns regarding the cost associated with this procedure. Further high-quality prospective observational studies and clinical trials, as well as new technologies specific for the pediatric population, are advisable for RALP to reach the level of gold standard.","authors":"C.

Six experimental procedures focusing on developing approaches to the parapharyngeal space and infratemporal fossa were performed on a total of 2 cadavers and 1 mongrel dog. Based on the preclinical work, transoral robotic surgery (TORS) was then performed in February 2007 on 1 human patient with a parapharyngeal to infratemporal fossa cystic neoplasm as part of a large prospective human trial.\n\n\nSETTING\nIn each cadaver and in the dog, a TORS approach to parapharyngeal space and infratemporal fossa was performed bilaterally and in an approved training facility using the da Vinci Surgical System. For the human surgical case, a TORS approach was evaluated on one side for a benign neoplasm. The human patient underwent TORS of the parapharyngeal space and infratemporal fossa under an institutional review board-approved prospective clinical trial.\n\n\nPATIENTS\nFor the human clinical trial, a TORS approach was evaluated for a patient with a benign neoplasm of the parapharyngeal space and infratemporal fossa.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe ability to access and dissect tissues within the various areas of the parapharynx and infratemporal fossa was evaluated, and techniques to enhance visualization and instrumentation were developed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nUsing TORS approaches permitted excellent access, visualization, and tissue dissection within the parapharyngeal space and infratemporal fossa in both the cadaver and canine experiments. In the first known human surgical case, TORS was used to remove a parapharyngeal space and infratemporal fossa cystic neoplasm. Wide visualization, followed by complete resection using the identical techniques developed in the preclinical models, was achieved. The robotic procedure allowed adequate and safe identification of the internal carotid artery and cranial nerves, and excellent hemostasis was achieved with no complications during or after surgery.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe TORS approaches provided excellent 3-dimensional visualization and instrument access that allowed successful parapharyngeal space and infratemporal fossa surgical resections from cadaver models to the first known human patient application. Robotic surgery for the skull base holds potential as a minimally invasive approach to skull base neoplasms; however, continued development and investigation is warranted in a prospective human clinical trial before final conclusions can be drawn as to the full advantages and limitations of this approach.","authors":"B.

Nevertheless the literature on this topic is rapidly expanding there is still no consensus about benefits of robotic rectal cancer surgery over the laparoscopic one. For this reason a review of all the literature examining robotic surgery for rectal cancer was performed. Two reviewers independently conducted a search of electronic databases (PubMed and EMBASE) using the key words \u201crectum\u201d, \u201crectal\u201d, \u201ccancer\u201d, \u201claparoscopy\u201d, \u201crobot\u201d. After the initial screen of 266 articles, 43 papers were selected for review. A total of 3013 patients were included in the review. The most commonly performed intervention was low anterior resection (1450 patients, 48.1%), followed by anterior resections (997 patients, 33%), ultra-low anterior resections (393 patients, 13%) and abdominoperineal resections (173 patients, 5.7%). Robotic rectal surgery seems to offer potential advantages especially in low anterior resections with lower conversions rates and better preservation of the autonomic function. Quality of mesorectum and status of and circumferential resection margins are similar to those obtained with conventional laparoscopy even if robotic rectal surgery is undoubtedly associated with longer operative times. This review demonstrated that robotic rectal surgery is both safe and feasible but there is no evidence of its superiority over laparoscopy in terms of postoperative, clinical outcomes and incidence of complications. In conclusion robotic rectal surgery seems to overcome some of technical limitations of conventional laparoscopic surgery especially for tumors requiring low and ultra-low anterior resections but this technical improvement seems not to provide, until now, any significant clinical advantages to the patients.","authors":"F.

However, due to a lack of data on long term results, controversy still exists regarding its oncological efficacy. In this multi-institutional series collected from four European Centres with high volumes of robotic procedures, we evaluate the results after robot-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy for thymoma.\n\n\nMETHODS\nBetween 2002 and 2014, 134 patients (61 males and 73 females, median age 59 years) with a clinical diagnosis of thymoma were operated on using a left-sided (38%), right-sided (59.8%) or bilateral (2.2%) robotic approach. Seventy (52%) patients had associated myasthenia gravis (MG).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe average operative time was 146 minutes (range, 60-353 minutes). Twelve (8.9%) patients needed open conversion: in one case, a standard thoracoscopy was performed after robotic system breakdown, and in six cases, an additional access was required. Neither vascular and nerve injuries, nor perioperative mortality occurred. A total of 23 (17.1%) patients experienced postoperative complications. Median hospital stay was 4 days (range, 2-35 days). Mean diameter of resected tumors was 4.4 cm (range, 1-10 cm), Masaoka stage was I in 46 (34.4%) patients, II in 71 (52.9%), III in 11 (8.3%) and IVa\/b in 6 (4.4%) cases. At last follow up, 131 patients were alive, three died (all from non-thymoma related causes) with a 5-year survival rate of 97%. One (0.7%) patient experienced a pleural recurrence.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur data suggest that robotic thymectomy for thymoma is a technically feasible and safe procedure with low complication rates and short hospital stays. Oncological outcome appears to be good, particularly for early-stage tumors, but a longer follow-up period and more cases are necessary in order to consider this as a standard approach. Indications for robotic thymectomy for stage III or IVa thymomas are rare and should be carefully evaluated.","authors":"G. Marulli, J. Maessen, F. Melfi, T. Schmid, M. Keijzers, O. Fanucchi, F.

Benchmark values are novel and objective tools for such comparisons. The aim of this study was to identify benchmark cutoffs for many outcome parameters for DP with or without splenectomy beyond the learning curve. Methods: This study analyzed outcomes from international expert centers from patients undergoing robotic DP for malignant or benign lesions. After excluding the first 10 cases in each center to reduce the effect of the learning curve, consecutive patients were included from the start of robotic DP up to June 2020. Benchmark patients had no significant comorbidities. Benchmark cutoff values were derived from the 75th or the 25th percentile of the median values of all benchmark centers. Benchmark values were compared with a laparoscopic control group from 4 high-volume centers and published open DP landmark series. Results: Sixteen centers contributed 755 cases, whereof 345 benchmark patients (46%) were included the analysis. Benchmark cutoffs included: operation time \u2264300 minutes, conversion rate \u22643%, clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula \u226432%, 3 months major complication rate \u226426.7%, and lymph node retrieval \u22659. The comprehensive complication index at 3 months was \u22648.7 without deterioration thereafter. Compared with robotic DP, laparoscopy had significantly higher conversion rates (5\u00d7) and overall complications, while open DP was associated with more blood loss and longer hospital stay. Conclusion: This first benchmark study demonstrates that robotic DP provides superior postoperative outcomes compared with laparoscopic and open DP. Robotic DP may be expected to become the approach of choice in minimally invasive DP.","authors":"P. M\u00fcller, E. Breuer, F. Nickel, S. Zani, E. Kauffmann, L. de Franco, C.

Given the many facilities provided by the robotic platform in the manipulation of tissues and precision of movements, there is continuous enquiring about its contribution to the improvement of surgical outcomes. Also, the possibility to perform complex resections in a minimally invasive way using a robotic approach starts to become possible as the centers\u2019 learning curve expands. We propose to perform a review of the current status of robotic surgery for lung cancer focusing on key frontier points: sublobar resections, quality of lymphadenectomy, complex resections, postoperative outcomes, and innovative technologies to arrive. Methods We performed a narrative review of the literature aggregating the most current references available in English. Key Content and Findings According to the current data, the flourishing of the robotic platform seems to be in line with the spread of sublobar resections. The technological benefits inherent to the platform, also seem to promote an increase in the quality of lymphadenectomy and a shorter learning curve when compared to video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) with equivalent oncological results. Its application in complex resections such as bronchial sleeve already presents consistent results and new technology acquisitions such as three-dimensional reconstructions, augmented reality and artificial intelligence tend to be implemented collaborating with the digitization of surgery. Conclusions Robotic surgery for lung cancer resection is at least equivalent to the VATS approach considering the currently available literature.

However, less is known about which of these individual measures are important with regard to clinically relevant perioperative outcomes such as ischemia time (IT), estimated blood loss (EBL), length of hospital stay (LOS), and change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) after robotic partial nephrectomy (PN). We aimed to assess the utility of the RENAL and PADUA scores, their subscales, and C-index for predicting these outcomes. Materials and Methods: We analyzed imaging studies from 283 patients who underwent robotic PN between 2008 and 2014 to assign nephrometry scores (NS): PADUA, RENAL and C-index. Univariate linear regression was used to assess whether the NS or any of their subscales were associated with EBL or IT. Multivariable linear regression and linear regression models were created to assess LOS and eGFR. Results: The three NS were significantly associated with EBL, IT, LOS, and eGFR at 12 months after surgery. All subscales with the exception of anterior\/posterior were significantly associated with EBL and IT. Collecting system, renal rim location, renal sinus, exophytic\/endophytic, and nearness to collecting system were significant predictors for LOS. Only renal rim location, renal sinus invasion and polar location were significantly associated with eGFR at 12 months. Conclusions: Tumor size and depth are important characteristics for predicting robotic PN outcomes and thus could be used individually as a simplified way to report tumors features for research and patient counseling purposes.","authors":"R.

However, it is unclear what advantages the robotic approach offers over other approaches in left colectomy. This study aims to explore the advantage of robotic surgery in left colectomy by comparing open, laparoscopic, and robotic surgery. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data of patients with radical left colectomy for colon cancer who were admitted to the Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, from November 2012 to November 2017. Two hundred eleven patients included were divided into the open surgery group (OS, n =49), laparoscopic surgery group (LS, n =92), and robotic surgery group (RS, n =70) according to surgical techniques. The clinicopathologic data were collected for clinical outcome assessment. Finally, the clinical value of RS in radical left colectomy was further evaluated by propensity score matching (PSM) analysis. Results Three groups were similar in demographics and clinical characteristics. Compared with OS, LS and RS groups had better intraoperative and perioperative clinical outcomes. Moreover, the RS group exhibited the minimum operative times, length of stay (LOS), and evaluated blood loss. LS and RS also exhibited less perioperative and postoperative long-term complications. Three groups showed similar postoperative pathological outcomes. The overall survival and disease-free survival were also similar among the three groups (all P > 0.05). Cox regression analysis showed surgical approach was not a prognostic factor for overall survival ( P = 0.671) and disease-free survival ( P = 0.776). PSM analysis of RS and LS by clinical characteristics showed RS showed shorter operation time ( P < 0.001) and LOS for patients without complications ( P = 0.005). However, no significant differences were found in perioperative and long-term postoperative complications, pathological outcomes, overall survival, and disease-free survival. Conclusions Among three techniques for radical left colectomy, LS and RS had significant advantages over OS in short-term clinical outcomes, and no significant differences were found in overall, disease-free survival, local recurrence, and distant metastasis incidence. Moreover, RS shows better perioperative clinical outcomes but without compromising survival compared with LS.","authors":"Zhixiang Huang, Tai-yuan Li, Genghua Zhang, Zhen Zhou, Haoran Shi, Cheng Tang, Lingling Yang, X.

The suitability of ambulatory surgery for patients with OSA remains controversial, and several national guidelines call for more evidence that assesses clinically significant outcomes. In this study, we investigate the association between OSA status (STOP-BANG risk, or previously diagnosed) and short-term outcomes and safety for patients undergoing cancer surgery at a freestanding ambulatory surgery facility.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients having surgery at the Josie Robertson Surgery Center, a freestanding ambulatory surgery facility of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Surgeries included more complex ambulatory extended recovery procedures for which patients typically stay overnight, such as mastectomy, thyroidectomy, and minimally invasive hysterectomy, prostatectomy, and nephrectomy, as well as typical outpatient surgeries. Both univariate and multivariable analyses were used to assess the association between OSA risk and transfer to the main hospital, urgent care center visit, and hospital readmission within 30 days postoperatively (primary outcomes) and length of stay and discharge time (secondary outcomes). Multivariable models were adjusted for age, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, robotic surgery, and type of anesthesia (general or monitored anesthesia care) and also adjusted for surgery start time for length of stay and discharge time outcomes. \u03c7 tests were used to assess the association between OSA risk and respiratory events and device use.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 5721 patients included in the analysis, 526 (9.2%) were diagnosed or at moderate or high risk for OSA. We found no evidence of a difference in length of stay when comparing high-risk or diagnosed patients with OSA to low- or moderate-risk patients whether they underwent outpatient (P = .2) or ambulatory extended recovery procedures (P = .3). Though a greater frequency of postoperative respiratory events were reported in high-risk or diagnosed patients with OSA compared to moderate risk (P = .004), the rate of hospital transfer was not significantly different between the groups (risk difference, 0.78%; 95% CI, -0.43% to 2%; P = .2). On multivariable analysis, there was no evidence of increased rate of urgent care center visits (adjusted risk difference, 1.4%; 95% CI, -0.68% to 3.4%; P = .15) or readmissions within 30 days (adjusted risk difference, 1.2%; 95% CI, -0.40% to 2.8%; P = .077) when comparing high-risk or diagnosed OSA to low- or moderate-risk patients. Based on the upper bounds of the CIs, a clinically relevant increase in transfers, readmissions, and urgent care center visits is unlikely.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results contribute to the body of evidence supporting that patients with moderate-risk, high-risk, or diagnosed OSA can safely undergo outpatient and advanced ambulatory oncology surgery without increased health care burden of extended stay or hospital admission and avoiding adverse postoperative outcomes. Our results support the adoption of several national OSA guidelines focusing on preoperative identification of patients with OSA and clinical pathways for perioperative management and postoperative monitoring.","authors":"Betsy Szeto, E.

There is currently no standardised surgical training for those willing to make their first attempts at minimally invasive pancreatic surgery. This study aims to ascertain the learning curve in minimally invasive pancreatic surgery. A systematic search of PubMed, Embase and Web of Science was performed up to March 2021. Studies investigating the number of cases needed to achieve author-declared competency in minimally invasive pancreatic surgery were included. In total, 31 original studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria with 2682 patient outcomes being analysed. From these studies, the median learning curve for distal pancreatectomy was reported to have been achieved in 17 cases (10\u201330) and 23.5 cases (7\u201340) for laparoscopic and robotic approach respectively. The median learning curve for pancreaticoduodenectomy was reported to have been achieved at 30 cases (4\u201360) and 36.5 cases (20\u201380) for a laparoscopic and robotic approach respectively. Mean operative times and estimated blood loss improved in all four surgical procedural groups. Heterogeneity was demonstrated when factoring in the level of surgeon\u2019s experience and patient\u2019s demographic. There is currently no gold standard in the evaluation of a learning curve.

More recently, the Da Vinci robotic surgery system has promoted the development of several surgical approaches with less morbidity and better cosmetic results, including the transaxillary and retroauricular approaches for thyroid surgery and neck dissections. In South America, there are several shortcomings regarding financial resources as well as the lack of support for innovation leading to a significant delay in adoption of numerous technological advances in medical practice. Despite these obstacles, we obtained training in transoral robotic surgery and neck procedures, and then decided to implement neck endoscopic and robotic surgery at our institution. We developed a collaborative training program with Yonsei University that, together with several local measures, allowed for a safe implementation. From June 2014 to December 2016, we have performed a total of 121 retroauricular neck surgeries, of which 65 were robotic-assisted and 56 were endoscopic assisted procedures, with a complication rate that seems to be comparable to conventional procedures in our experience and a smooth learning curve. Safety compliance has been continuously assessed. Aiming to develop and disseminate these techniques, we have ongoing collaborative work with Yonsei University faculty, to continue increasing our clinical experience, and we are now preparing the group and infrastructure to establish a local training program for South American surgeons. We have been presenting our results at national and international medical meetings and started to publish the preliminary results in peer reviewed medical journals. The emphasis is that a retroauricular approach is a therapeutic option to be considered, especially for young patients. Media exposure has been avoided so far. As expected, resistance by our peers is still present and much more work is needed to overcome it, including the generation of data on the outcomes and a critical analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of endoscopic and robotic neck surgery.","authors":"R.

This review aims to elucidate current developments in colorectal robotic surgery.In colon surgery, robotic techniques are associated with longer operative times and higher costs compared with laparoscopic surgery. However, robotics provides a stable camera platform and articulated instruments that are not subject to human tremors. Because of these advantages, robotic systems can play a role in complex procedures such as the dissection of lymph nodes around major vessels. In addition robot-assisted hand-sewn intracorporeal anastomoses can be easily performed by the surgeon, without a substantial need for a competent assistant. At present, although the short-term outcomes and oncological adequacy of robotic colon resection have been observed to be acceptable, the long-term outcomes of robotic colon resection remain unknown.In rectal surgery, robotic-assisted surgery for rectal cancer can be carried out safely and in accordance with current oncological principles. However, to date, the impact of robotic rectal surgery on the long-term oncological outcomes of minimally invasive total mesorectal excision remains undetermined. Robotic total mesorectal excision may allow for better preservation of urinary and sexual functions, and robotic surgery may attenuate the learning curve for laparoscopic rectal resection. However, a major drawback to robotic rectal surgery is the high cost involved.Large-scale prospective randomized clinical trials such as the international randomized trial ROLARR are required to establish the benefits of robotic rectal surgery.","authors":"S.

The goals in treating head and neck cancer are to cure patients, as well as to provide quality of life by improving functional and social outcomes through organ-preservation therapies, which may include surgery, chemotherapy, and\/or radiation therapy. Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) is an emerging technique that provides several benefits over existing treatment regimens and over open surgery for head and neck cancer, including reductions in operative times, blood loss, intensive care unit stays, and overall duration of patient hospitalization. Transoral robotic techniques allow wide-view, high-resolution, magnified three-dimensional optics for visualization of the mucosal surfaces of the head and neck through an endoscope, while avoiding the extensive external cervical incisions often required for open surgeries. Radiologists play an important role in the successful outcome of these procedures, both before and after TORS. Determining a cancer patient's surgical candidacy for TORS requires a thorough preoperative radiologic evaluation, coupled with clinical and intraoperative assessment. Radiologists must pay particular attention to important anatomic landmarks that are clinical blind spots for surgeons. Knowledge of the expected postoperative imaging appearances, so that they can be distinguished from recurrent disease and second primary tumors, is essential for all radiologists involved in the care of these patients.","authors":"L.

Follow-up was conducted at 90 days, 6 months, and 12 months, with final follow-up on September 23, 2021.\n\n\nInterventions\nParticipants were randomized to receive robot-assisted radical cystectomy with intracorporeal reconstruction (n\u2009=\u2009169) or open radical cystectomy (n\u2009=\u2009169).\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nThe primary outcome was the number of days alive and out of the hospital within 90 days of surgery. There were 20 secondary outcomes, including complications, quality of life, disability, stamina, activity levels, and survival. Analyses were adjusted for the type of diversion and center.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 338 randomized participants, 317 underwent radical cystectomy (mean age, 69 years; 67 women [21%]; 107 [34%] received neoadjuvant chemotherapy; 282 [89%] underwent ileal conduit reconstruction); the primary outcome was analyzed in 305 (96%). The median number of days alive and out of the hospital within 90 days of surgery was 82 (IQR, 76-84) for patients undergoing robotic surgery vs 80 (IQR, 72-83) for open surgery (adjusted difference, 2.2 days [95% CI, 0.50-3.85]; P\u2009=\u2009.01).

During recent years, the application of the laparoscopic approach to liver resection has grown less than other abdominal specialties due to the intrinsic limitations of laparoscopic instruments. Robotics can overcome these limitations above all for complex operations. A review of the literature on major hepatic surgery was conducted on PubMed using selected keywords. Two hundred and thirty-five patients in 17 series were analysed and outcomes such as operative time, estimated blood loss, length of hospital stay, complications, conversion rate, and costs were described. The most commonly performed procedures were wedge resection and segmentectomy, but the predominance of major hepatectomies performed with robotic surgery is likely due to the superior control achieved by the robotic system. The conversion and complication rates were 4.2% and 13.4%, respectively. Intracavitary fluid collections and bile leaks were the most frequently occurring morbidities. The mean operation time was 285 min. The mean intraoperative blood loss was 50\u2013280 mL. The mean postoperative hospital stay was four to seven days. Overall survival and long-term outcomes were not reported. Robotic liver surgery in Italy has become a clinical reality that is gaining increasing acceptance; a survey was carried out on robotic surgery, which showed that it is perceived as a significant advantage for operators and a consistent gain for the patient. More than 100 robotic hepatic resections have been performed in Italy where important robotic training schools are active. Robotic liver surgery is feasible and safe in trained and experienced hands. Further evaluation is required to assess the improvement in outcomes and long-term oncologic follow-up.","authors":"P. Reggiani, B. Antonelli, G.

As the median age of diagnosis is 73, many patients are elderly at the time of cystectomy. We compare perioperative surgical outcomes in elderly patients undergoing robotic vs open radical cystectomy (RC).\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPatients >75 years at time of RC were identified. Demographic, clinicopathologic, and perioperative variables were examined. Estimated blood loss (EBL) and length of stay (LOS) data were collected with multivariate linear regression analysis performed to assess whether technique was independently associated with outcomes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEighty-seven patients >75 years of age underwent cystectomy for MIBC (58 open, 29 robotic). Mean age was 79.6 (\u00b13.2) and 79.2 (\u00b13.5) for open and robotic groups, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.64). There were no significant differences in baseline comorbidities, clinical or pathologic stage, or use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The mean number of lymph nodes removed was similar (p\u2009=\u20090.08). Robotic cystectomy had significantly longer mean OR times (p\u2009<\u20090.001). On multivariate analyses, robotic surgery was associated with -389cc less EBL (95% CI -547 to -230, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and a -1.5-day-shortened LOS (95%CI -2.9 to -0.2, p\u2009=\u20090.02) compared with open surgery. There were no significant differences in surgical complications or 90-day readmission rates between the two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRobotic cystectomy is safe and feasible in an elderly population. We observed longer OR times with robotic surgery, but with decreased EBL, shorter hospital stays, and comparable complication and readmission rates with open RC.

Different surgical approaches have emerged and been utilized successively, including traditional laparoscopy, single-hole laparoscopy, robotic laparoscopy, vaginal-assisted laparoscopy, and transvaginal approaches. Robotic sacrocolpopexy (RSC) has attracted increasing attention as an emerging surgical technique and has unique advantages, such as a \u201csimulated wrist\u201d mechanical arm and high-definition three-dimensional (3D) visual field, which has gradually begun to be utilized in the clinical setting. Methods We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting checklist, and a systematic literature search was conducted on six databases from their inception to 1st March 2020. We evaluated patients with POP who underwent RSC or laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (LSC), outcomes (including perioperative outcomes: blood loss, operating times, blood transfusion, and hospital stay), surgery-related complications, as well as cure and recurrence rates. Results A total of 49 articles were available, including 3,014 patients, among which 18 were comparative studies on LSC vs. RSC, and 31 were non-comparative single-arm studies on RSC. For RSC, median operative time was 226 [90\u2013604] minutes, estimated blood loss was 56 [5\u20131,500] mL, and hospital stay was 1.55 [1\u201316] days. Intraoperative complications and postoperative complications occurred in 74 (2.7%) and 360 (13.0%) patients, respectively. Of 2,768 RSC patients, 40 had been converted from a robot-assisted approach to other approaches, and 134 of 1,852 patients (7.2%) have recurrent prolapses of any compartment. Compared to LSC, RSC was associated with significantly lower blood loss and lower conversion rate. However, more operative time was observed in RSC. No significant differences were observed in perioperative transfusion, intraoperative and postoperative complications, or objective recurrence between RSC and LSC. Conclusions RSC\u2019s application seems to contribute some advantages compared to conventional laparoscopic surgery, although both approaches appear to promote equivalent clinical outcomes. Notably, heterogeneity among studies might have affected the outcome of the study. Consequently, high-quality and large-sample randomized trials comparing both techniques are necessitated.","authors":"Jiang Yang, Yong He, Xiaoyi Zhang, Zhi Wang, Xiaohu Zuo, Likun Gao, L.

Laparoscopic TAPP (LTAPP) is recommended for bilateral repairs. Likewise, the introduction of robotic platforms has promised additional surgical benefits for robotic TAPP (RTAPP), which are yet to be confirmed. This study compared multicenter data obtained from patients undergoing bilateral inguinal hernia repair with RTAPP, performed during the preliminary learning curve period, versus conventional LTAPP. Materials and methods All consecutive bilateral inguinal hernia patients from four Italian centers between June 2015 and July 2020 were selected. A propensity score model was used to compare patients treated with LTAPP versus RTAPP, considering sex, age, body mass index, current smoking status, overall comorbidity, hernia classification (primary or recurrent), and associated procedures as covariates. After matching, intraoperative details and postoperative outcomes were evaluated. Results In total, 275 LTAPP and 40 RTAPP were performed. After matching, 80 and 40 patients were allocated to the LTAPP and RTAPP cohorts, respectively. No intraoperative complications or conversion to open surgery occurred. However, a longer operative time was recorded in the RTAPP group (79\u2009\u00b1\u200921 versus 98\u2009\u00b1\u200929\u00a0min; p \u2009<\u20090.001). Postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores ( p \u2009=\u20090.13) did not differ and complication rates were similar. There were no clinical recurrences in either group, with mean follow-up periods of 52\u2009\u00b1\u200914 (LTAPP) and 35\u2009\u00b1\u20098 (RTAPP) months.

The aim of this study was the investigation of differences between the two techniques, and a comparison when approaching right or left side adrenal lesions was further conducted. Materials and Methods: All patients undergoing laparoscopic and robotic unilateral adrenalectomy at our institution from January 2006 to December 2019 were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Statistical analysis was conducted; differences between the two cohorts were reported. Results: A total of 160 cases were included (84 patients in laparoscopic adrenalectomy-group [LA-g] 76 cases in robotic adrenalectomy-group [RA-g]). The groups were homogeneous for demographic data. No intraoperative complications were reported; mean amount of intraoperative blood loss was comparable. No cases of conversion to open surgery were required. RA-g presented a longer operative time than LA-g for right adrenalectomy (P\u2009=\u2009.05), no differences were noted for left side (P\u2009=\u2009.187). Overall morbidity was 21% for LA-g and 10.5% for RA-g (P\u2009=\u2009.087), with an inferior rate of surgical complications for RA-g (P\u2009=\u2009.024), and for robotic left adrenalectomy than robotic right procedure (P\u2009=\u2009.03). Length of hospital stay was shorter for RA-g (P\u2009=\u2009.005). Conclusions: Robotic adrenalectomy presents similar outcomes as laparoscopic approach with some benefits for selected cases. Left adrenal lesions seem to receive greater advantages from robotic technique. Large randomized controlled trials are required to determine the role of robotic adrenal surgery and if the indication can be standardized based on the laterality of adrenal procedure.","authors":"M.

Electrodes were implanted bilaterally in the globus pallidus internus (GPi) using the Neuromate robot without the stereotactic frame. The authors calculated the distances between the electrodes and their respective planned trajectories, merging the postoperative CT with the preoperative plan using VoXim software. Clinical outcome was monitored using validated scales for dystonia and myoclonus preoperatively and at 1 month and 6 months postoperatively and by means of a quality-of-life questionnaire for children, administered before surgery and at 6 months' follow-up. We also recorded complications derived from the implantation technique, \"hardware,\" and stimulation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSix patients aged 7 to 16 years and diagnosed with isolated dystonia ( DYT1 negative) (3 patients), choreo-dystonia related to PDE2A mutation (1 patient), or myoclonus-dystonia syndrome SGCE mutations (2 patients) were evaluated during a period of 6 to 19 months. The average accuracy in the placement of the electrodes was 1.24 mm at the target point. At the 6-month follow-up, patients showed an improvement in the motor (65%) and functional (48%) components of the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale. Patients with myoclonus and SGCE mutations also showed an improvement in action myoclonus (95%-100%) and in functional tests (50%-75%) according to the Unified Motor-Rating Scale. The Neuro-QOL score revealed inconsistent results, with improvement in motor function and social relationships but worsening in anxiety, cognitive function, and pain. The only surgical complication was medial displacement of the first electrode, which limited intensity of stimulation in the lower contacts, in one case.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Neuromate stereotactic robot is an accurate and safe tool for the placement of GPi electrodes in children with hyperkinetic movement disorders.","authors":"S.

Active robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one such technique that is capable of providing accurate implant position and restoring mechanical alignment. Although relevant studies have been carried out, the differences in the efficacy and reliability between active robotic-assisted TKA and conventional arthroplasty have not yet been adequately discussed. Methods We referenced articles, including randomised controlled trials and comparative retrospective research, from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science, in order to compare active robotic-assisted TKA with the conventional technique. Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted for each study. Statistical analysis was performed using Revman V. 5.3. Results Seven studies with a total of 517 knees undergoing TKA were included. Compared with conventional surgery, active robotic TKA showed better outcomes in precise mechanical alignment (mean difference, MD: \u2212 0.82, 95%\u2009CI: \u22121.15 to \u2212 0.49, p < 0.05) and implant position, with lower outliers (p < 0.05), better functional score (Western Ontario and McMaster University, Knee Society Score functional score) and less drainage (MD: \u2212 293.28, 95%\u2009CI: \u2212 417.77 to \u2212 168.79, p < 0.05).

Robotic technology is more expensive and whether a robotically assisted approach is cost-effective remains to be determined.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA decision-analytic model was constructed to evaluate the 1-year costs and quality-adjusted time between robotic, laparoscopic, and open colectomy. Model inputs were derived from available literature for costs, quality of life (QOL), and outcomes. Results are presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), defined as incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the effect of clinically reasonable variations in the inputs on our results.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOpen colectomy cost more and achieved lower QOL than robotic and laparoscopic approaches. From the societal perspective, robotic colectomy costs $745 more per case than laparoscopy, resulting in an ICER of $2,322,715\/QALY because of minimal differences in QOL. From the healthcare sector perspective, robotics cost $1339 more per case with an ICER of $4,174,849\/QALY. In both models, laparoscopic colectomy was more frequently cost-effective across a wide range of willingness-to-pay thresholds. Sensitivity analyses suggest robotic colectomy becomes cost-effective at $100,000\/QALY if robotic disposable instrument costs decrease below $1341 per case, robotic operating room time falls below 172 minutes, or robotic hernia rate is less than 5%.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLaparoscopic and robotic colectomy are more cost-effective than open resection. Robotics can surpass laparoscopy in cost-effectiveness by achieving certain thresholds in QOL, instrument costs, and postoperative outcomes. With increased use of robotic technology in colorectal surgery, there is a burden to demonstrate these benefits.","authors":"Vlad V. Simianu, W. Gaertner, K. Kuntz, Mary R. Kwaan, A. Lowry, R.

Indeed, mUKA is a technically challenging procedure strongly related to surgeons' skills and expertise. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the likelihood of robotic-assisted surgery in reducing the variability of coronal and sagittal component positioning between high- and low-volume surgeons. We evaluated a prospective cohort of 161 robotic mUKA implanted between May 2018 and December 2019 at two high-volume robotic centers. Patients were divided into two groups: patients operated by \u201chigh-volume\u201d (group A) or \u201clow-volume\u201d (group B) surgeons. We recorded intraoperative lower-limb alignment, component positioning, and surgical timing. Postoperatively, every patient underwent a radiographical protocol to assess coronal and sagittal femoral\/tibial component alignment. Range of motion and other clinical outcomes were assessed pre- and 12 months postoperatively by using oxford knee score, forgotten joint score, and visual analog scale. Of 161 recruited knees, 149 (A: 101; B: 48) were available for radiographic analysis at 1 month, and clinical evaluation at 12 months. No clinical difference neither difference in mechanical alignment nor coronal\/sagittal component positioning were found (p\u2009>\u20090.05). A significant difference was recorded in surgical timing (A: 57\u2009minutes; B: 86\u2009minutes; p\u2009<\u20090.05). No superficial or deep infections or other major complications have been developed during the follow-up. Robotics surgery in mUKA confirmed its value in improving the reproducibility of such technical procedure, with satisfactory clinical outcomes. Moreover, it almost eliminates any possible differences in component positioning, and lower limb alignment among low-and high- volume knee surgeons.","authors":"F. Matassi, M.

Its relative success (still at a low single-digit percentile total market penetration) roots in the particular human-in-the-loop control, in which the trained surgeon is always kept responsible for the clinical outcome achieved by the robot-actuated invasive tools. Nowadays, this paradigm is challenged by the need for improved surgical performance, traceability, and safety reaching beyond the human capabilities. Partially due to the technical complexity and the financial burden, the adoption of telesurgical robotics has not reached its full potential, by far. Apart from the absolutely market-dominating da Vinci surgical system, there are already 60+ emerging RAMIS robot types, out of which 15 have already achieved some form of regulatory clearance. This article aims to connect the technological advancement with the principles of commercialization, particularly looking at engineering components that are under development and have the potential to bring significant advantages to the clinical practice. Current RAMIS robots often do not exceed the functionalities deriving from their mechatronics, due to the lack of data-driven assistance and smart human\u2013machine collaboration. Computer assistance is gradually gaining more significance within emerging RAMIS systems. Enhanced manipulation capabilities, refined sensors, advanced vision, task-level automation, smart safety features, and data integration mark together the inception of a new era in telesurgical robotics, infiltrated by machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. Observing other domains, it is definite that a key requirement of a robust AI is the good quality data, derived from proper data acquisition and sharing to allow building solutions in real time based on ML.

AIM To determine risk factors for postoperative complications after minimally invasive gastrectomy for GC. METHODS Between January 2009 and June 2019, 1716 consecutive patients were referred to our division for primary GC. Among them, 1401 patients who were diagnosed with both clinical and pathological Stage III or lower GC and underwent robotic gastrectomy (RG) or laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) were enrolled. Retrospective chart review and multivariate analysis were performed for identifying risk factors for postoperative morbidity. RESULTS Morbidity following minimally invasive gastrectomy was observed in 7.5% of the patients. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that non-robotic minimally invasive surgery, male gender, and an operative time of \u2265 360 min were significant independent risk factors for morbidity. Therefore, morbidity was compared between RG and LG. Accordingly, propensity-matched cohort analysis revealed that the RG group had significantly fewer intra-abdominal infectious complications than the LG group (2.5% vs 5.9%, respectively; P = 0.038), while no significant differences were noted for other local or systemic complications. Multivariate analyses of the propensity-matched cohort revealed that non-robotic minimally invasive surgery [odds ratio = 2.463 (1.070\u20135.682); P = 0.034] was a significant independent risk factor for intra-abdominal infectious complications.

The widespread use and improved outcomes of the hepatectomy were, primarily, due to pioneer surgeons who were responsible for technological advances and rapid improvements in the safety of the procedure in the last century. These advances included the hepatic functional evaluation used to determine the safety limit of liver resections, the introduction of intraoperative ultrasonography, and the development of innovative techniques such as portal vein embolization to increase the remnant liver volume. Cadaveric liver transplantation has been attempted since 1963. However, the clinical outcomes only began improving and becoming acceptable in the 1970s\u20101980s due to refinements in technology and the development of new immunosuppressants. Partial liver transplantation from living donors, which was first attempted in 1988, required further technological innovation and sophisticated perioperative management plans. Moreover, these developments allowed for further overall improvements to take place in the field of liver surgery. Since the turn of the century, advances in computation and imaging technology have made it possible for safer and more elaborate surgeries to be performed. In Japan, preoperative 3\u2010dimensional simulation technology has been covered by health insurance since 2012 and is now widely used. An urgent need for real\u2010time navigation tools will develop in the future. Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging was first used in 2007 and has led to the creation of a new surgical concept known as fluorescence navigation surgery. Laparoscopic surgery and robotic surgery have solved the issue of large incisions, which used to be a major drawback of open liver surgery; however, further improvements are required in order to achieve the level of safety and accuracy observed during open liver resection when performing all minimally invasive procedures. In the near future, liver surgery will become more precise and less invasive due to substantial progress including the development of navigation surgery, cancer imaging, and minimally invasive surgery. This overview of the history of liver surgery over the past 50 years may provide useful insights for further innovation in the next 50 years.","authors":"N. Kokudo, N. Takemura, K. Ito, F.

The quality of evidence was evaluated using GRADE methods.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nTen RCTs were included in the review. The studies randomised 973 participants experiencing pain or subfertility associated with endometriosis. Five RCTs compared laparoscopic ablation or excision versus diagnostic laparoscopy only. Two RCTs compared laparoscopic excision versus diagnostic laparoscopy only. Two RCTs compared laparoscopic excision versus ablation. One RCT compared laparoscopic ablation versus diagnostic laparoscopy and injectable gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue (GnRHa) (goserelin) with add-back therapy.

The similar effect of laparoscopic surgery and diagnostic laparotomy on the rate of miscarriage per pregnancy was imprecise (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.54, 2 studies, 112 women, moderate quality evidence).When laparoscopic ablation was compared with diagnostic laparoscopy plus medical therapy (GnRHa plus add-back therapy), more women in the ablation group reported that they were pain free at 12 months (OR 5.63, 95% CI 1.18 to 26.85, 1 RCT, 35 participants, low quality evidence).The difference between laparoscopic ablation and laparoscopic excision in the proportion of women reporting overall pain relief at 12 months on a VAS 0 to 10 pain scale was 0 (95% CI -1.22 to 1.22, P = 1.00, 1 RCT, 103 participants, low quality evidence).\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThere is moderate quality evidence that laparoscopic surgery to treat mild and moderate endometriosis reduces overall pain and increases live birth or ongoing pregnancy rates. There is low quality evidence that laparoscopic excision and ablation were similarly effective in relieving pain, although there was only one relevant study. More research is needed considering severe endometriosis, different types of pain associated with endometriosis (for example dysmenorrhoea (pain with menstruation)) and comparing laparoscopic interventions with holistic and medical interventions. There was insufficient evidence on adverse events to allow any conclusions to be drawn regarding safety.","authors":"J. M. Duffy, K. Arambage, F. Corr\u00eaa, D. Olive, Cindy Farquhar, R. Garry, D.

This follows reporting of the primary outcomes of implant accuracy and gait analysis that showed significant advantages in the robotic arm-assisted group. Methods A total of 139 patients were recruited from a single centre. Patients were randomised to receive either a manual UKA implanted with the aid of traditional surgical jigs, or a UKA implanted with the aid of a tactile guided robotic arm-assisted system. Outcome measures included the American Knee Society Score (AKSS), Oxford Knee Score (OKS), Forgotten Joint Score, Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale, University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) activity scale, Short Form-12, Pain Catastrophising Scale, somatic disease (Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders Score), Pain visual analogue scale, analgesic use, patient satisfaction, complications relating to surgery, 90-day pain diaries and the requirement for revision surgery. Results From the first post-operative day through to week 8 post-operatively, the median pain scores for the robotic arm-assisted group were 55.4% lower than those observed in the manual surgery group (p = 0.040). At three months post-operatively, the robotic arm-assisted group had better AKSS (robotic median 164, interquartile range (IQR) 131 to 178, manual median 143, IQR 132 to 166), although no difference was noted with the OKS. At one year post-operatively, the observed differences with the AKSS had narrowed from a median of 21 points to a median of seven points (p = 0.106) (robotic median 171, IQR 153 to 179; manual median 164, IQR 144 to 182). No difference was observed with the OKS, and almost half of each group reached the ceiling limit of the score (OKS > 43). A greater proportion of patients receiving robotic arm-assisted surgery improved their UCLA activity score. Binary logistic regression modelling for dichotomised outcome scores predicted the key factors associated with achieving excellent outcome on the AKSS: a pre-operative activity level > 5 on the UCLA activity score and use of robotic-arm surgery. For the same regression modelling, factors associated with a poor outcome were manual surgery and pre-operative depression. Conclusion Robotic arm-assisted surgery results in improved early pain scores and early function scores in some patient-reported outcomes measures, but no difference was observed at one year post-operatively. Although improved results favoured the robotic arm-assisted group in active patients (i.e. UCLA \u2a7e 5), these do not withstand adjustment for multiple comparisons. Cite this article: M. J. G.

Deconstructing a procedure into discrete instrument-tissue \u201cgestures\u201d is a emerging way to understand surgery. To establish this paradigm in a procedure where performance is the most important factor for patient outcomes, we identify 34,323 individual gestures performed in 80 nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomies from two international medical centers. Gestures are classified into nine distinct dissection gestures (e.g., hot cut) and four supporting gestures (e.g., retraction). Our primary outcome is to identify factors impacting a patient\u2019s 1-year erectile function (EF) recovery after radical prostatectomy. We find that less use of hot cut and more use of peel\/push are statistically associated with better chance of 1-year EF recovery. Our results also show interactions between surgeon experience and gesture types\u2014similar gesture selection resulted in different EF recovery rates dependent on surgeon experience. To further validate this framework, two teams independently constructe distinct machine learning models using gesture sequences vs. traditional clinical features to predict 1-year EF. In both models, gesture sequences are able to better predict 1-year EF (Team 1: AUC 0.77, 95% CI 0.73\u20130.81; Team 2: AUC 0.68, 95% CI 0.66\u20130.70) than traditional clinical features (Team 1: AUC 0.69, 95% CI 0.65\u20130.73; Team 2: AUC 0.65, 95% CI 0.62\u20130.68). Our results suggest that gestures provide a granular method to objectively indicate surgical performance and outcomes. Application of this methodology to other surgeries may lead to discoveries on methods to improve surgery.","authors":"Runzhuo Ma, Jiashu Xu, Jiashu Xu, Loc Trinh, Dani Kiyasseh, Timothy N.

Robotic surgery, with its multijoint function, overcomes the disadvantages of motion limitation in laparoscopic surgery, prevents camera shake, and enables surgical precision with magnified stereoscopic effect. However, at this time, the superiority of robotic surgery over laparoscopic surgery is not fully clear in terms of shortterm or longterm surgical outcomes. Practitioners anxiously await the findings of future randomized controlled trials. In this issue of the Annals of Gastroenterological Surgery, Terashima has reviewed the history of challenges in gastric cancer surgery from the era of Billroth to the present, including advances in open gastric cancer surgery, laparoscopic surgery, and the introduction of robotic surgery.1 In addition, he imagines the future surgical landscape, including the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) and new technologies involving surgical robots. It should be noted that roboticassisted surgery is a kind of remote surgery that happens right in the operating room. In other words, the surgeon operates the robotic arm remotely from a cockpit at a distance from the patient. For this reason, from its inception, robotic surgery has been developed with the goal of realizing remote surgery. The basic concept is the \u201cdigitization of surgery,\u201d and remote surgery is theoretically possible by converting the surgeon's visual information and hand movements into digitized video and coordinate signals for transmission. Telesurgery has been studied extensively since the 19 70s. In 2001, the world's first remote laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed between New York, the United States, and Strasbourg, France (Lindbergh procedure),2 followed by 22 clinical telesurgeries in Canada,3 all of which were reported to be successful. Thus, the feasibility of telesurgery has been proven, but many issues have been identified, such as the high cost of dedicated communication lines, the security and redundancy of communication, the delays associated with the compression and decompression of transmission signals, and the delays associated with remote communication. The rapid development of information and communication technology and highspeed communication networks in recent years has created a communication environment in which remote surgery can be realized by overcoming the problems of transmission delay, communication security, and the high cost of communication. At the same time, information processing technology for compressing and decompressing robot signals and video signals has also made progress, so issues such as transmission delay, transmission jitter, and signal packet loss associated with information processing have been improved. Many previous studies on telesurgery reported that common general surgeries can be performed if the transmission delay is <200 ms and that the delay has little effect if it is <100 ms.4,5 It is assumed that the current level of information processing and communication technology meets these standards. In addition, competition to develop new surgical robots has begun both in Japan and overseas as patents related to earlier surgical robots expire. The development of surgical robots for advanced telesurgery is also underway. Thus, technological innovation is creating the prerequisites for the social implementation of telesurgery. So why is telesurgery getting renewed attention today? In Japan, there is a shortage of surgeons in rural areas due to the uneven regional distribution of physicians between large cities and rural areas and a decrease in the number of applicants for surgical residencies. Telesurgery is expected to be an incentive to get young surgeons to work in rural areas, as they can continue to receive surgical education and support from supervisors at core facilities while engaging in community medicine in rural areas. As the population in Japan is rapidly aging, the need for minimally invasive surgery, including robotassisted surgery, is increasing. However, it is difficult to receive all the latest medical treatments in rural areas where medical resources are scarce. The availability of telesurgery is expected to increase the options for patients to receive a variety of specialized treatments at local medical institutions and reduce the risks and financial burden associated with longdistance travel.

Objectives: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as disruptive technologies with the potential to drastically affect clinical decision making in spine surgery. AI can enhance the delivery of spine care in several arenas: (1) preoperative patient workup, patient selection, and outcome prediction; (2) quality and reproducibility of spine research; (3) perioperative surgical assistance and data tracking optimization; and (4) intraoperative surgical performance. The purpose of this narrative review is to concisely assemble, analyze, and discuss current trends and applications of AI and ML in conventional and robotic-assisted spine surgery. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive PubMed search of peer-reviewed articles that were published between 2006 and 2019 examining AI, ML, and robotics in spine surgery. Key findings were then compiled and summarized in this review. Results: The majority of the published AI literature in spine surgery has focused on predictive analytics and supervised image recognition for radiographic diagnosis. Several investigators have studied the use of AI\/ML in the perioperative setting in small patient cohorts; pivotal trials are still pending. Conclusions: Artificial intelligence has tremendous potential in revolutionizing comprehensive spine care. Evidence-based, predictive analytics can help surgeons improve preoperative patient selection, surgical indications, and individualized postoperative care. Robotic-assisted surgery, while still in early stages of development, has the potential to reduce surgeon fatigue and improve technical precision.","authors":"Jonathan J Rasouli, Jianning Shao, Sean N.

Orthopaedic surgery began to incorporate robotic technology in 1992, with the introduction of ROBODOC, for the planning and performance of total hip replacement. The use of robotic systems has subsequently increased, with promising short-term radiological outcomes when compared with traditional orthopaedic procedures. Robotic systems can be classified into two categories: autonomous and haptic (or surgeon-guided). Passive surgery systems, which represent a third type of technology, have also been adopted recently by orthopaedic surgeons. While autonomous systems have fallen out of favour, tactile systems with technological improvements have become widely used. Specifically, the use of tactile and passive robotic systems in unicompartmental knee replacement (UKR) has addressed some of the historical mechanisms of failure of non-robotic UKR. These systems assist with increasing the accuracy of the alignment of the components and produce more consistent ligament balance. Short-term improvements in clinical and radiological outcomes have increased the popularity of robot-assisted UKR. Robot-assisted orthopaedic surgery has the potential for improving surgical outcomes. We discuss the different types of robotic systems available for use in orthopaedics and consider the indication, contraindications and limitations of these technologies.","authors":"Jason E.

In this issue of Annals of Surgical Oncology are two articles about MIS approaches for rectal cancer, one comparing open versus laparoscopic proctectomy and the other comparing laparoscopic versus robotic approaches. These articles offer an opportunity to encourage the systematic validation of these technologies through clinical trials as they are increasingly adopted for colorectal surgery. Over the past decade, urologists have made great strides in implementing robotic surgery for pelvic procedures, although the surgical oncology and colorectal surgery communities have not yet embraced this technology at the same pace. For example, in 2007, approximately 50,000 radical prostatectomies were performed with the Da Vinci robot system in the United States, or approximately 60% of radical prostatectomies. In general, the reported results of robotic prostatectomy demonstrated less blood loss and shorter length of hospital stay; although the potency and continence rates were comparable, a trend was noted toward a faster return of functional outcomes. The gynecological community has also started to use the robotic system, which has shown similar results to those described by urologists for prostatectomy. That is, compared with open or laparoscopic techniques, robotic surgery for radical hysterectomy resulted in less blood loss, fewer postoperative complications, and shorter length of stay. Last year, Mattias Soop and Heidi Nelson, in an editorial published in Annals of Surgical Oncology, wrote, \u2018\u2018we believe that the cumulative literature now supports an equipoise on short term advantages and long-term oncologic outcomes (for laparoscopic proctectomy for cancer), making the case for large prospective randomized trials.\u2019\u2019 Since the COST study group published its results in 2004 showing equivalence in oncologic outcomes between open and laparoscopic resection of colon cancer, the use of laparoscopic techniques for colon cancer has become popular and has now expanded to include rectal cancer patients. The data for rectal cancer is still being generated, but the randomized Conventional Versus Laparoscopic-Assisted Surgery in Colorectal Cancer (CLASICC trial), as well as several retrospective studies, demonstrate that the use of laparoscopic techniques has at least equivalent oncologic outcomes compared with an open laparotomy approach. For example, in this issue of Annals of Surgical Oncology is a multivariate analysis of 421 consecutive patients with stage II and stage III rectal cancer conducted by Law and colleagues who retrospectively compared outcomes of open versus laparoscopic resection. Laparoscopic resection was associated with significantly less blood loss and shorter hospital stay and was one of the independent significant factors associated with better survival (P = .03, hazard ratio .558, 95% confidence interval .339\u2013.969). Ng and colleagues from Hong Kong reported last year in Annals of Surgical Oncology the preliminary results of a randomized trial comparing open versus laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection in 99 rectal cancer patients with a follow-up of 90 months. Their results showed that postoperative recovery was better after laparoscopic surgery, and 5-year survival was identical. These results are consistent with other studies showing that laparoscopic colon resection provides better perioperative outcomes compared with open laparotomy, including decreased postoperative pain, earlier return to normal physical function, quicker return to bowel function, and shorter hospital stays.

Findings CLS shows significant advantages in total operative time, net operative time, total complication rate, and operative cost (p < 0.05 in all cases), whereas the estimated blood loss was less in RLS (p < 0.05). As subgroup analyses, conversion rate on colectomy and length of hospital stay on hysterectomy statistically favors RLS (p < 0.05).

Initial clinical trials have successfully implanted selected subjects using robotics. Conclusions: The use of robotics in cochlear implants remains in its very early stages. It is hoped that robotics will improve clinical outcomes. Although successful implants with robots are reported in the literature, there are some challenges that need to be addressed before this approach can become an acceptable option for the conventional cochlear implant surgery, such as safety, time, efficiency, and cost.

The objective of this study is to determine the optimal alignment technique in TKA by comparing patient satisfaction, functional outcomes, implant survivorship, complications, and cost-effectiveness in MA TKA versus FA TKA. Robotic technology will be used to execute the planned implant positioning and limb alignment with high-levels of accuracy in all study patients. Methods and analysis This prospective double-blinded randomised control trial will include 100 patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis undergoing primary robotic arm-assisted TKA. Following informed consent, patients will be randomised to MA TKA (the control group) or FA TKA (the investigation group) at a ratio of 1:1 using an online random number generator. Blinded observers will review patients at regular intervals for 2 years after surgery to record predefined study outcomes relating to postoperative rehabilitation, clinical progress, functional outcomes, accuracy of implant positioning and limb alignment, gait, implant stability, cost-effectiveness, and complications. A superiority study design will be used to evaluate whether FA TKA provides superior outcomes compared to MA TKA. Primary and secondary objectives will be used to quantify and draw inferences on differences in the efficacy of treatment between the two groups. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol population analysis will be undertaken.

Methods A total of 33 patients with medial compartment OA of the knee were prospectively allocated on alternate operative days of their surgery to MAKO (16 patients) or NAVIO (17 patients) robot-assisted UKA. The primary outcome (Knee Society Score [KSS] and Knee Functional Score [KFS]) and the secondary outcomes (intraoperative time of seven steps [registration of hip and ankle, femur and tibia, ligament tension, implant planning, preparation femur, tibia and trial implant], component alignment [coronal and sagittal of femur, tibia implant], blood loss, complications, and revision at 1\u2009year after surgery) were compared between two groups. Statistical significance was set at P <\u20090.05. Results Mean KSS measured at baseline and 1\u2009year were, respectively, 70.3 (5.6) and 96.9 (5.7) in the NAVIO group and 72.3 (4.5) and 94.7 (10.01) in the MAKO group. Mean KFS measured at baseline and 1\u2009year were, respectively, 95.5 (7.9) and 99.9 (0.25) in the NAVIO group and 67.3 (7.8) and 99.5 (1.2) in the MAKO group. There were no significant differences for KFS and KSS outcomes ( P \u00a0=\u20090.203 and P \u00a0=\u20090.457, respectively) between the NAVIO and MAKO groups.

Prior studies in open and laparoscopic colorectal surgery, such as PILLAR II, have demonstrated a low anastomotic leak rate (1.4%). As the minimally invasive approach progresses from laparoscopic to robotic approach, the effect and safety of IcGA in assessing anastomotic perfusion in the latter deserve further investigation. Methods The objective of the study was to determine the safety of IcGA in guiding intraoperative management of robotic assisted colorectal resection via perfusion assessment. The design was single-surgeon, retrospective case-control study. 74 patients underwent left-sided robotic assisted colorectal resection and anastomosis with IcGA guidance. 30 historical controls underwent left-sided robotic assisted colorectal resection and anastomosis without IcGA. Clinical, demographic, operative, and outcome variables were tabulated. Results In the control group, 1 patient suffered a postoperative anastomotic stricture requiring no surgery, and 1 patient suffered an anastomotic dehiscence requiring return to the operating room. There were no anastomotic complications in the IcGA group, including 4 patients who underwent a change in the chosen level of anastomosis based on intraoperative IcGA. Conclusion IcGA is safe to use as demonstrated by the very low rate of complications in this case series. It is also safe to rely on to guide re-resection and recreation of an anastomosis intraoperatively by demonstration of blood flow. This may help offset the loss of tactile feedback and assessment of tension in the robotic platform.","authors":"E. Shapera, R.

Methods: Thirty-six consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic and robot-assisted THE for malignant disease over a 3-year period were identified in a retrospective database. Eighteen patients underwent robotic-assisted THE with cervical anastomosis, and 18 patients underwent laparoscopic THE. All procedures were performed by a single foregut and thoracic surgeon. Results: Patient demographics were similar between the 2 groups with no significant differences. Lymph node yields for both laparoscopic and robot-assisted THE were similar at 13.9 and 14.3, respectively (P = .90). Ninety-four percent of each group underwent R0 margins, but only 1 patient from each modality had microscopic positive margins. All of the robot-assisted patients underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation, whereas 83.3% underwent neoadjuvant therapy in the laparoscopy group (P = .23).

The authors provide a brief historical perspective to lay the foundations of the modern understanding of clinical nerve injury and its evolving management, especially over the last century. The shift from evaluation of the nerve injury using macroscopic techniques of exploration and external neurolysis to microscopic interrogation, interfascicular dissection, and internal neurolysis along with the use of intraoperative electrophysiology were important advances of the past 50 years. By the late 20th century, the advent and popularization of interfascicular nerve grafting techniques heralded a major advance in nerve reconstruction and allowed good outcomes to be achieved in a large percentage of nerve injury repair cases. In the past 2 decades, there has been a paradigm shift in surgical nerve repair, wherein surgeons are not only directing the repair at the injury zone, but also are deliberately performing distal-targeted nerve transfers as a preferred alternative in an attempt to restore function. The peripheral rewiring approach allows the surgeon to convert a very proximal injury with long regeneration distances and (often) uncertain outcomes to a distal injury and repair with a greater potential of regenerative success and functional recovery. Nerve transfers, originally performed as a salvage procedure for severe brachial plexus avulsion injuries, are now routinely done for various less severe brachial plexus injuries and many other proximal nerve injuries, with reliably good to even excellent results. The outcomes from nerve transfers for select clinical nerve injury are emphasized in this review. Extension of the rewiring paradigm with nerve transfers for CNS lesions such as spinal cord injury and stroke are showing great potential and promise. Cortical reeducation is required for success, and an emerging field of rehabilitation and restorative neurosciences is evident, which couples a nerve transfer procedure to robotically controlled limbs and mind-machine interfacing. The future for peripheral nerve repair has never been more exciting.","authors":"R. Midha, J.

Exceptional precision is required to operate on micron scale targets presented by the retina while also maneuvering in a tightly constrained and fragile workspace.

It is typically performed using an approach (standard RALP) that mimics open retropubic prostatectomy by dissecting the so-called space of Retzius anterior to the bladder. An alternative, Retzius-sparing (or posterior approach) RALP (RS-RALP) has been described, which is reported to have better continence outcomes but may be associated with a higher risk of incomplete resection and positive surgical margins (PSM).\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effects of RS-RALP compared to standard RALP for the treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe performed a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, trials registries, other sources of the grey literature, and conference proceedings, up to June 2020. We applied no restrictions on publication language or status.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included trials where participants were randomized to RS-RALP or standard RALP for clinically localized prostate cancer.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently classified and abstracted data from the included studies. Primary outcomes were: urinary continence recovery within one week after catheter removal, at three months after surgery, and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were: urinary continence recovery six and 12 months after surgery, potency recovery 12 months after surgery, positive surgical margins (PSM),\u00a0biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS), and urinary and sexual function quality of life. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nOur search identified six\u00a0records of five unique randomized controlled trials, of which two\u00a0were published studies, one was in press,\u00a0and two\u00a0were abstract proceedings. There were 571 randomized participants, of whom 502 completed the trials. Mean age of participants was 64.6 years and mean prostate-specific antigen was 6.9 ng\/mL. About 54.2% of participants had cT1c disease, 38.6% had cT2a-b disease, and 7.1 % had cT2c disease. Primary outcomes RS-RALP probably improves continence within one week after catheter removal (risk ratio (RR) 1.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41 to 2.14; I2 = 0%; studies = 4; participants = 410; moderate-certainty evidence). Assuming 335 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP are continent at this\u00a0time point,\u00a0this corresponds to 248 more men per 1000 (137 more to 382 more) reporting continence recovery. RS-RALP may increase continence at three months after surgery compared to standard RALP (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.68; I2 = 86%; studies = 5; participants = 526; low-certainty evidence). Assuming 750\u00a0per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP are continent at this\u00a0time point, this corresponds to 224 more men per 1000 (41 more to 462 more) reporting continence recovery. We are very uncertain about the effects of RS-RALP on serious adverse events compared to standard RALP (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.47 to 4.17; studies = 2; participants = 230; very low-certainty evidence). Secondary outcomes There is probably little to no difference in continence recovery at 12 months after surgery (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.04; I2 = 0%; studies = 2; participants = 222; moderate-certainty evidence). Assuming 982\u00a0per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP are continent at this\u00a0time point, this corresponds to 10 more men per 1000 (29 fewer to 39 more) reporting continence recovery.\u00a0 We are very uncertain about the effect of RS-RALP\u00a0on potency recovery 12 months after surgery (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.80; studies = 1; participants = 55; very low-certainty evidence).\u00a0 RS-RALP may increase PSMs (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.20; I2 = 0%; studies = 3;\u00a0participants = 308; low-certainty evidence) indicating a higher risk for\u00a0prostate cancer recurrence. Assuming 129\u00a0per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP have positive margins, this corresponds to 123 more men per 1000 (25 more to 284 more) with PSMs. We are very uncertain about the effect of RS-RALP on BCRFS\u00a0compared to standard RALP (hazard ratio (HR) 0.45, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.60; I2 = 32%; studies = 2; participants = 218; very low-certainty evidence).\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nFindings of this review indicate that RS-RALP may result in better continence outcomes than standard RALP up to six months after surgery.

However, the effectiveness of sentinel node biopsy, its value to patients, and potential harms compared with no-node dissection have never been shown in a randomized trial. Primary Objectives Stage 1 will test recovery from surgery. Stage 2 will compare disease-free survival at 4.5 years between patients randomized to sentinel node biopsy versus no retroperitoneal node dissection. Study Hypothesis The primary hypothesis for stage 1 is that treatment with sentinel node biopsy will not cause detriment to patient outcomes (lymphedema, morbidity, loss of quality of life) and will not increase treatment-related morbidity or health services costs compared with patients treated without a retroperitoneal node dissection at 12 months after surgery. The primary hypothesis for stage 2 is that disease-free survival at 4.5 years after surgery in patients without retroperitoneal node dissection is not inferior to those receiving sentinel node biopsy. Trial Design This phase III, open-label, two-arm, multistage, randomized non-inferiority trial (ENDO-3) will determine the value of sentinel node biopsy for surgical management of endometrial cancer. Patients with endometrial cancer are randomized to receive: (1) laparoscopic\/robotic hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with sentinel node biopsy or (2) laparoscopic\/robotic hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy without retroperitoneal node dissection. In stage 1, 444 patients will be enrolled to demonstrate feasibility and quality of life. If this is demonstrated, we will enroll another 316 patients in stage 2. Major Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Inclusion criteria include women aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed endometrial cancer; clinical stage 1, who meet the criteria for laparoscopic or robotic total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Patients with uterine mesenchymal tumors are excluded. Primary Endpoints The endpoint for stage 1 is surgical recovery, with the proportion of patients returning to usual daily activities at 3 months post-surgery as measured with the EQ-5D. Stage 2 is disease-free survival at 4.5 years. Sample Size 760 participants (both stages).

We aimed to assess the diffusion of pediatric RAS in Italy, the training period, indications, preliminary outcomes, and limitations. Materials and Methods: An online questionnaire-based survey was performed. The data about robotic activity of 9 Italian Pediatric Surgery units were collected and analyzed. Results: Most of the participating centers (7\/9, 77.8%) started RAS less than 5 years ago with only 2 centers (22.2%) performing RAS since 2010. The training included dry-lab in 5\/9 centers (55.5%), wet-lab in 5\/9 centers (55.5%), and robot simulator in 7\/9 centers (77.8%), followed by an exam to obtain a certificate. The average duration of training was 23.7 hours (range 5-50). A total of 209 robotic procedures was performed in all centers during the period 2010-2018 and included 119 urological (56.9%), 31 gynecological (14.8%), 41 gastrointestinal (19.6%), 12 oncological (5.7%), and 6 other (2.8%) procedures. The docking time significantly fell down after 18 robotic procedures (P\u2009=\u2009.001). Intraoperative complications were recorded in 4 cases (1.9%). Conversion to laparoscopy was needed in 4 cases (1.9%) whereas conversion to open was required in 6 cases (2.8%). Postoperative complications occurred in 17\/209 cases (8.1%) and were graded Clavien I-II in 14 cases (6.7%) and Clavien IIIb in only 4 cases (1.9%). Conclusions: Our study confirmed that RAS has still a limited diffusion in Italy for pediatric patients. Before starting robotic activity, pediatric surgeons have to obtain a certificate after a virtual and experimental training period. A mentorship clinical period of 10 cases under supervision of a proctor is also needed. The main indications in children remain reconstructive urological procedures. RAS is safe in children but its applications are currently limited to patients older than 2 years and with a weight >15\u2009kg, due to the size of robotic ports.","authors":"C. Esposito, L.

In this study, we report the preliminary experience and clinical outcome of robotic assisted quadrantectomy (RAQ) and immediate partial breast reconstruction (IPBR) with RLDFH. Patient concern: Decreasing and avoid back scar length after latissimus dorsi flap harvest. Diagnoses: One 28\u200ayears old female with left breast cancer underwent RAQ and IPBR with RLDFH. Initially, she was diagnosed with left breast infiltrating carcinoma that was clinical stage T3N1M0 and triple negative. Interventions: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of 4 cycles of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by 4 cycles of docetaxel was performed. Breast magnetic resonance imaging showed residual breast cancer about 4.5\u200acm over the left upper outer quadrant of the breast. Sentinel lymph node biopsy showed no lymph node metastasis. RAQ, which took 82 minutes, was performed first, and the resected breast specimen's weight was 203 gm. She received IPBR with RLDFH, which took 97 minutes. Outcomes: The overall blood loss was 40 mL. The final pathology result was ypT2 (4.2\u200acm)N0 (sn0\/3)M0 and stage IIA. The resection margin was free of tumors. The post-operative recovery was smooth except for seroma formation over the back, which was relieved after repeated aspiration at an outpatient clinic. The patient was satisfied with the post-operative scar and aesthetic outcome. No local recurrence, distant metastasis or case mortality was found during 5 months of follow-up. Lessons: RAQ and IPBR with RLDFH is a safe alternative for small-to-medium-breast-size women with breast cancer who desire breast conservation and are indicated for volume replacement with autologous latissimus dorsi flap.","authors":"H.

However, the comparative morbidity and outcomes of this minimally invasive procedure relative to traditional subdural electrode (SDE) implantation are unknown.\n\n\nObjective\nTo perform a comparative analysis of the relative efficacy, procedural morbidity, and epilepsy outcomes consequent to SEEG and SDE in similar patient populations and performed by a single surgeon at 1 center.\n\n\nDesign, Setting and Participants\nOverall, 239 patients with medically intractable epilepsy underwent 260 consecutive intracranial electroencephalographic procedures to localize their epilepsy. Procedures were performed from November 1, 2004, through June 30, 2017, and data were analyzed in June 2017 and August 2018.\n\n\nInterventions\nImplantation of SDE using standard techniques vs SEEG using a stereotactic robot, followed by resection or laser ablation of the seizure focus.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nLength of surgical procedure, surgical complications, opiate use, and seizure outcomes using the Engel Epilepsy Surgery Outcome Scale.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 260 cases included in the study (54.6% female; mean [SD] age at evaluation, 30.3 [13.1] years), the SEEG (n\u2009=\u2009121) and SDE (n\u2009=\u2009139) groups were similar in age (mean [SD], 30.1 [12.2] vs 30.6 [13.8] years), sex (47.1% vs\u200943.9% male), numbers of failed anticonvulsants (mean [SD], 5.7 [2.5] vs 5.6 [2.5]), and duration of epilepsy (mean [SD], 16.4 [12.0] vs17.2 [12.1] years). A much greater proportion of SDE vs SEEG cases were lesional (99 [71.2%] vs 53 [43.8%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Seven symptomatic hemorrhagic sequelae (1 with permanent neurological deficit) and 3 infections occurred in the SDE cohort with no clinically relevant complications in the SEEG cohort, a marked difference in complication rates (P\u2009=\u2009.003). A greater proportion of SDE cases resulted in resection or ablation compared with SEEG cases (127 [91.4%] vs 90 [74.4%]; P\u2009< .001). Favorable epilepsy outcomes (Engel class I [free of disabling seizures] or II [rare disabling seizures]) were observed in 57 of 75 SEEG cases (76.0%) and 59 of 108 SDE cases (54.6%; P\u2009=\u2009.003) amongst patients undergoing resection or ablation, at 1 year. An analysis of only nonlesional cases revealed good outcomes in 27 of 39 cases (69.2%) vs 9 of 26 cases (34.6%) at 12 months in SEEG and SDE cohorts, respectively (P\u2009=\u2009.006). When considering all patients undergoing evaluation, not just those undergoing definitive procedures, favorable outcomes (Engel class I or II) for SEEG compared with SDE were similar (57 of 121 [47.1%] vs 59 of 139 [42.4%] at 1 year; P\u2009=\u2009.45).\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nThis direct comparison of large matched cohorts undergoing SEEG and SDE implantation reveals distinctly better procedural morbidity favoring SEEG. These modalities intrinsically evaluate somewhat different populations, with SEEG being more versatile and applicable to a range of scenarios, including nonlesional and bilateral cases, than SDE. The significantly favorable adverse effect profile of SEEG should factor into decision making when patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy are considered for intracranial evaluations.","authors":"N.

To assess the benefits of RAS, we conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials comparing laparoscopic and robotic-assisted sacrocolpopexy. The Cochrane Library (1970\u2013January 2015), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2015), and EMBASE (1974 to January 2015) were searched, as well as ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We identified two randomized trials (n\u2009=\u200978) comparing laparoscopic with robotic sacrocolpopexy. The Paraiso 2011 study showed that laparoscopic was faster than robotic sacrocolpopexy (199\u2009\u00b1\u200946 vs. 265\u2009\u00b1\u200950\u00a0min; p\u2009<\u2009.001), yet in the ACCESS trial, no difference was present (225\u2009\u00b1\u200962.3 vs. 246.5\u2009\u00b1\u200951.3\u00a0min; p\u2009=\u2009.110). Costs for using the robot were significantly higher in both studies, however, in the ACCESS trial, only when purchase and maintenance of the robot was included (LSC US$11,573\u2009\u00b1\u20093191 vs. RASC US$19,616\u2009\u00b1\u20093135; p\u2009<\u2009.001). In the Paraiso study, RASC was more expensive even without considering those costs (LSC US$ 14,342\u2009\u00b1\u20092941 vs. RASC 16,278\u2009\u00b1\u20093326; p\u2009=\u20090.008). Pain was reportedly higher after RASC, although at different time points after the operation. There were no differences in anatomical outcomes, pelvic floor function, and quality of life. The experience with RASC was tenfold lower than that with LSC in both studies. The heterogeneity between the two studies precluded a meta-analysis. Based on small randomized studies, with surgeons less experienced in RAS than in laparoscopic surgery, robotic surgery significantly increases the cost of a laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy. RASC would be more sustainable if its costs would be lower. Though RASC may have other benefits, such as reduction of the learning curve and increased ergonomics or dexterity, these remain to be demonstrated.","authors":"G. Callewaert, J. Bosteels, S.

Recently, ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), an AIpowered chatbot developed by OpenAI, has created a ruckus throughout the world and hits the international headlines frequently. ChatGPT is a natural language processing model and could generate human-like text, allowing users to obtain answers in an intuitive and conversational way. In the initial release version, ChatGPT is a fine-tuned application based on the GPT-3.5 engine. Over the past few months, multiple studies have demonstrated that ChatGPT\/GPT-3.5 have great potential in medical applications, such as providing professional medical advice, identifying top research questions, as well as helping in academic writing. However, many scholars also pointed out that in many cases, the answers from GPT-3.5 were too general and vague and even provided incorrect answers. Meanwhile, another major drawback of GPT-3.5 is its non-capability of inputting a picture. On 14 March 2023, OpenAI unveiled GPT-4, the latest incarnation of this popular chatbot. Of great concern is that it could accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs. In addition, according to the report from the OpenAI team, ChatGPT\/GPT-4 exhibited human-level performance on a variety of professional and academic benchmarks. And even could pass a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, there has been no study to assess the potential impact of ChatGPT, especially GPT4, on the field of surgery. And also, the rapid development of ChatGPT leads us to ask whether it will topple the profession of surgeons? As shown in Figure 1, we have summarized several potential applications of ChatGPT\/GPT-4 in multiple aspects of surgical work. There have been multiple studies that evaluated the important role of ChatGPT in scientific writing, which is just as applicable to the surgical area. Therefore, this study mainly focuses on its value during perioperative management. Generally speaking, since each patient\u2019s condition, constitution, and recovery capabilities vary, the complex and high-risk decisions made by surgeons under time constraints and uncertainty have a significant impact on patient treatment outcomes. Especially in emergency situations, surgeons often need to make critical decisions in a short period of time. Diagnostic and judgment errors are the second most common cause of preventable harm in surgical patients. Recently, AI technologies, including embodied AI in robotics and techniques like machine learning, are being developed and utilized in the surgical field to assist surgeons in tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring patient outcomes. As for ChatGPT\/GPT-4, this system may also have greater potential for patients\u2019 preoperative planning, intraoperative decision-making, and postoperative monitoring. For example, ChatGPT could help surgeons collect and analyze patients\u2019 medical history, laboratory findings, and imaging features so as to provide a personalized surgical plan and also assist in surgical simulations to assess the safety and adaptability of operative procedures and predict surgical outcomes. Compared with GPT3.5, one of the major highlights of GPT-4 is the capacity to handle images. In most cases, apart from clinical examination, surgeons rely on imaging modalities to confirm the diagnosis. Combined with deep learning and big data technology, ChatGPT could help surgeons analyze medical images such as X-ray and computed tomography scans more efficiently and accurately.

So, we developed a casecontrol study in order to compare the surgical outcome of robotic group with a control group of laparoscopic approach in patients with symptomatic apical pro-lapsed between January 2015 and December 2015 at University Hospital Policlinico \"P.

Our experience shows that robotic sacrocolpopexy can be considered in positive way for clinical results obtained: all procedures were executed with no complications, we noted a lower intraoperative blood loss and a shorter hospital stay than in laparoscopic group. Although the mean operative time and the economic costs are higher in robotic surgery, this study demonstrates that the use of robotic platform for repairing of symptomatic apical vaginal prolapse is feasible, safe and associated with short-term satisfactory results, representing therefore a valid alternative to laparoscopic approach.","authors":"G.

In part due to the non-standardized nature of these approaches, single site robotic prostatectomy has not been widely adopted. With the recent approval of the da Vinci (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale CA) Single Port (SP) platform, there has been a renewed interest in single site robotic-assisted prostatectomy and several institutions have begun reporting their initial experiences with this technique. In this systematic review, we sought to assess and summarize the literature regarding patient outcomes for single site robotic-assisted prostatectomy and evaluate its role in surgical treatment of prostate cancer. This systematic review was structured using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies describing the use of any robotic platform, including da Vinci Si, Xi or SP platforms for robotic single-port or single site radical prostatectomy between 2000 and July 15, 2019 were eligible for inclusion in this systematic review. Studies were excluded if they included combined cases with other organ resection, represented use in a non-clinical setting (such as a cadaveric model), or described results for a simple prostatectomy technique. Data was extracted by two authors with concerns resolved by consensus. Primary outcomes were mean operative times, estimated blood loss (mL), and hospital length of stay (days). Secondary outcomes included intraoperative conversion to open surgery, and intraoperative and postoperative complications. Variables of interest included sample size (n), mean age (years), mean prostate size (mL), prostate specific antigen (PSA, ng\/mL), Gleason score, clinical and pathological TNM staging [American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC)], lymph nodes (n) and perioperative complications as available. A total of 217 studies were reviewed by title and abstract, with 28 selected for full-text review; ultimately, 12 studies were included, with available data from 145 patients. Primary outcomes and preoperative characteristics varied greatly amongst patients and across studies. One patient (0.7%) required conversion to a multi-port approach and there were no conversions to an open technique. No intraoperative complications were reported, and no Clavien grade III or greater postoperative complications have been described in the initial 81 radical prostatectomies performed with the SP platform. Single Port techniques appear to represent a safe and feasible approach for performing the minimally invasive radical prostatectomy. The current available literature on the single port radical prostatectomy is weak and consists of single center studies with small sample sizes, short-term follow up and limited functional data. More rigorous multi-center trials with standardized metrics for reporting functional outcomes as well as long-term cancer specific survival are necessary to validate these initial studies.","authors":"Andrew Lai, R.

Surgery, in the form of radical prostatectomy, is one of the main forms of treatment for men with localised prostate cancer. Prostatectomy has traditionally been performed as open surgery, typically via a retropubic approach. The advent of laparoscopic approaches, including robotic-assisted, provides a minimally invasive alternative to open radical prostatectomy (ORP).\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effects of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy or robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy compared to open radical prostatectomy in men with localised prostate cancer.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE) and abstract proceedings with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status, up until 9 June 2017. We also searched bibliographies of included studies and conference proceedings.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a direct comparison of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) to ORP, including pseudo-RCTs.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data. The primary outcomes were prostate cancer-specific survival, urinary quality of life and sexual quality of life. Secondary outcomes were biochemical recurrence-free survival, overall survival, overall surgical complications, serious postoperative surgical complications, postoperative pain, hospital stay and blood transfusions. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model and assessed the quality of the evidence according to GRADE.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included two unique studies with 446 randomised participants with clinically localised prostate cancer. The mean age, prostate volume, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of the participants were 61.3 years, 49.78 mL, and 7.09 ng\/mL, respectively. Primary outcomes We found no study that addressed the outcome of prostate cancer-specific survival. Based on data from one trial, RARP likely results in little to no difference in urinary quality of life (MD -1.30, 95% CI -4.65 to 2.05) and sexual quality of life (MD 3.90, 95% CI -1.84 to 9.64). We rated the quality of evidence as moderate for both quality of life outcomes, downgrading for study limitations. Secondary outcomes We found no study that addressed the outcomes of biochemical recurrence-free survival or overall survival.Based on one trial, RARP may result in little to no difference in overall surgical complications (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.04) or serious postoperative complications (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.32). We rated the quality of evidence as low for both surgical complications, downgrading for study limitations and imprecision.Based on two studies, LRP or RARP may result in a small, possibly unimportant improvement in postoperative pain at one day (MD -1.05, 95% CI -1.42 to -0.68 ) and up to one week (MD -0.78, 95% CI -1.40 to -0.17). We rated the quality of evidence for both time-points as low, downgrading for study limitations and imprecision. Based on one study, RARP likely results in little to no difference in postoperative pain at 12 weeks (MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.32 to 0.34). We rated the quality of evidence as moderate, downgrading for study limitations.Based on one study, RARP likely reduces the length of hospital stay (MD -1.72, 95% CI -2.19 to -1.25). We rated the quality of evidence as moderate, downgrading for study limitations.Based on two study, LRP or RARP may reduce the frequency of blood transfusions (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.46). Assuming a baseline risk for a blood transfusion to be 8.9%, LRP or RARP would result in 68 fewer blood transfusions per 1000 men (95% CI 78 fewer to 48 fewer). We rated the quality of evidence as low, downgrading for study limitations and indirectness.We were unable to perform any of the prespecified secondary analyses based on the available evidence. All available outcome data were short-term and we were unable to account for surgeon volume or experience.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThere is no high-quality evidence to inform the comparative effectiveness of LRP or RARP compared to ORP for oncological outcomes. Urinary and sexual quality of life-related outcomes appear similar.Overall and serious postoperative complication rates appear similar. The difference in postoperative pain may be minimal. Men undergoing LRP or RARP may have a shorter hospital stay and receive fewer blood transfusions. All available outcome data were short-term, and this study was unable to account for surgeon volume or experience.","authors":"D. Ili\u0107, S. Evans, C. Allan, J. Jung, D. Murphy, M.

We categorized annual average hospital RARP volume into very low, low, medium, high, and very high by most closely sorting final included patients into five equal-sized groups (quintiles). Outcomes included 30-day mortality, 90-day mortality, conversion (to open), prolonged length of stay (PLOS, >2 d), 30-day (unplanned) readmission, positive surgical margin (PSM), and lymph node dissection (LND) rates.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 114,957 patients were included and hospital volume was categorized into very low (3-45 cases\/year), low (46-72 cases\/year), medium (73-113 cases\/year), high (114-218 cases\/year), and very high (\u2265219 cases\/year). Overall 30-day mortality (0.12%), 90-day mortality (0.16%), and conversion rate (0.65%) were low. Multivariable logistic regressions showed that compared with very low volume group, higher hospital volume was associated with lower odds of conversion to open surgery (OR=0.23, p<0.001 for very high), pLOS (OR=0.25, p<0.001 for very high), 30-day readmission (OR=0.53, p<0.001 for very high), and PSM (OR=0.61, p<0.001 for very high). Higher hospital volume was also associated with higher odds of LND in the intermediate\/high-risk cohort (OR=3.23, p<0.001 for very high).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPatients undergoing RARP at higher volume hospitals are likely to have improved perioperative and superior oncologic outcomes than lower volume hospitals.","authors":"Leilei Xia, C.

Larger case series and comparison of distinct stereotactic methods for stereotactic laser corpus callosotomy (SLCC), however, are currently lacking. The objective of this study was to report seizure outcomes in a series of adult patients with epilepsy following anterior, posterior, and complete SLCC procedures and to compare the results achieved with a frameless stereotactic surgical robot versus direct MRI guidance frames.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe authors retrospectively reviewed sequential adult epilepsy surgery patients who underwent SLCC procedures at a single institution. They describe workflows, stereotactic errors, percentage disconnection, hospitalization durations, adverse events, and seizure outcomes after performing anterior, posterior, and complete SLCC procedures using a frameless stereotactic surgical robot versus direct MRI guidance platforms.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirteen patients underwent 15 SLCC procedures. The median age at surgery was 29 years (range 20-49 years), the median duration of epilepsy was 21 years (range 9-48 years), and median postablation follow-up was 20 months (range 4-44 months). Ten patients underwent anterior SLCC with a median 73% (range 33%-80%) midsagittal length of callosum acutely ablated. Following anterior SLCC, 6 of 10 patients achieved meaningful (> 50%) reduction of target seizures. Four patients underwent posterior (completion) SLCC following prior anterior callosotomy, and 1 patient underwent complete SLCC as a single procedure; 3 of these 5 patients experienced meaningful reduction of target seizures. Overall, 8 of 10 patients in whom astatic seizures were targeted and treated by anterior and\/or posterior SLCC experienced meaningful improvement. SLCC procedures with direct MRI guidance (n = 7) versus a frameless surgical robot (n = 8) yielded median radial accuracies of 1.1 mm (range 0.2-2.0 mm) versus 2.4 mm (range 0.6-6.1 mm; p = 0.0011). The most serious adverse event was a clinically significant intraparenchymal hemorrhage in a patient who underwent the robotic technique.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis is the largest reported series of SLCC for epilepsy to date. SLCC provides seizure outcomes comparable to open surgery outcomes reported in the literature. Direct MRI guidance is more accurate, which has the potential to reduce the risks of SLCC.

We present a novel machine learning (ML) method of processing automated performance metrics (APMs) to evaluate surgical performance and predict clinical outcomes after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nWe trained three ML algorithms utilizing APMs directly from robot system data (training material) and hospital length of stay (LOS; training label) (\u22642 days and >2 days) from 78 RARP cases, and selected the algorithm with the best performance. The selected algorithm categorized the cases as \"Predicted as expected LOS (pExp-LOS)\" and \"Predicted as extended LOS (pExt-LOS).\" We compared postoperative outcomes of the two groups (Kruskal-Wallis\/Fisher's exact tests).

Surgical skill assessment in Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (RAMIS) is essential for training and quality assurance. The mental workload on the surgeon (such as time criticality, task complexity, distractions) and non-technical surgical skills (including situational awareness, decision making, stress resilience, communication, leadership) may directly influence the clinical outcome of the surgery. METHODS: A literature search in PubMed, Scopus and PsycNet databases was conducted for relevant scientific publications. The standard PRISMA method was followed to filter the search results, including non-technical skill assessment and mental\/cognitive load and workload estimation in RAMIS. Publications related to traditional manual Minimally Invasive Surgery were excluded, and also the usability studies on the surgical tools were not assessed. RESULTS: 50 relevant publications were identified for non-technical skill assessment and mental load and workload estimation in the domain of RAMIS. The identified assessment techniques ranged from self-rating questionnaires and expert ratings to autonomous techniques, citing their most important benefits and disadvantages. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the systematic research, only a limited number of articles was found, indicating that non-technical skill and mental load assessment in RAMIS is not a well-studied area. Workload assessment and soft skill measurement do not constitute part of the regular clinical training and practice yet. Meanwhile, the importance of the research domain is clear based on the publicly available surgical error statistics. Questionnaires and expert-rating techniques are widely employed in traditional surgical skill assessment; nevertheless, recent technological development in sensors and Internet of Things-type devices show that skill assessment approaches in RAMIS can be much more profound employing automated solutions.

Methods: We prospectively analyzed the clinical and pathological outcomes of 108 consecutive patients who underwent RAPN for renal tumors from January 2012 to December 2016 by a laparoscopy trained surgeon with no prior robotic experience. We used warm ischemia time (WIT) <20 min, operative time <120 min, and blood loss <100 ml as endpoints for plotting the LCs. Trifecta was analyzed in relation to our LC. Results: Surgeon experience was found to correlate with WIT, operative time, and blood loss. Overall 18.5% of patients developed complications. Complication rate reduced with increasing surgeon experience. LC was 44 cases for WIT \u226420 min, 44 cases for operative time <120 min, and 54 cases for blood loss <100 ml. Trifecta outcome was achieved in 67.6% patients overall and was found to correlate with increasing surgeon experience. Improvement in trifecta outcomes continued to occur beyond the LC. Conclusions: RAPN is a viable option for nephron-sparing surgery in patients with renal carcinoma. For a surgeon trained in laparoscopy, acceptable perioperative outcomes following RAPN can be achieved after an LC of about 44 cases.

A new robot-assisted surgical procedure has been introduced to improve the accuracy of implant screw positioning.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned 135 patients with newly diagnosed cervical spinal disease and who required screw fixation using either robot-assisted or conventional fluoroscopy-assisted cervical spinal surgery. The primary outcomes were the discrepancies between the planned trajectories and the actual screw positions.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAltogether, 127 patients underwent the assigned intervention (61 robot-assisted and 66 conventional fluoroscopy-assisted). The baseline characteristics including the screw types, were similar in the two groups. Altogether, 390 screws were planed and placed in the cervical vertebrae, and 94.9% were acceptable. The robot-assisted group had a better screw placement accuracy than the conventional fluoroscopy-assisted group with associated p values <0.001 [0.83 (0.44, 1.29) vs 1.79 (1.41, 2.50) mm].

In spite of this, the laparoscopic technique is usually practised only in high-volume experienced centres, mainly because it requires a prolonged and demanding learning curve. It has been estimated that over 50 operations are required for an experienced colorectal surgeon to achieve proficiency with this technique. Robotic surgery enables the surgeon to perform minimally invasive operations with better vision and more intuitive and precise control of the operating instruments, thus promising to overcome some of the technical difficulties associated with standard laparoscopy. It has high-definition three-dimensional vision, it translates the surgeon's hand movements into precise movements of the instruments inside the patient, the camera is held and moved by the first surgeon, and a fourth robotic arm is available as a fixed retractor.

Design A generic online interactive tool was developed to analyze the (health) effects needed to compensate for the additional costs of using a surgical robotic system from a healthcare perspective. The application of the tool is illustrated with a hypothetical new surgical robotic platform. A synthesis of evidence from different sources was used combined with interviews with surgeons. Setting Flexible tool that can be adapted to flexible settings. Participants Any hospital patient group for which robotic, endoscopic or open surgical procedures may be considered as appropriate treatment alternatives (eg, urology, gynecology, and so on). Intervention Robotically assisted surgical interventions. Comparator Endoscopic or open surgical interventions. Main outcome measures Thresholds of how much (health) effect is needed for robot-assisted surgery to provide value for money and to become cost-effective. Results The utilization rate of the surgical robotic system and a reduction in complications appeared to be important aspects in determining the value for money. To become cost-effective, it was deemed important for new surgical robotic systems to have added clinical benefit and become less costly than the current system. Conclusions This paper and its assisting interactive tool can be used by clinicians, researchers, and policymakers to gain insight in the benefit needed to provide value for money when using a (new) surgical robotic system or, when the effects are known or can be estimated, to assess the value for money for a specific indication. For robotic surgery to provide most value for money, we recommend assessing for each indication whether the necessary effects seem achievable.","authors":"Sejal Patel, M. Rovers, M. Sedelaar, P.

This work has led to today\u2019s only commercially available total robotic system in the world, namely, the Da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Inc). This system obtained Food and Drug Administration approval for general surgical procedures in July 2000. The early efforts in robotic surgery have led to significant learning in the field and likely to allow greater advantages associated with minimally invasive surgery that began in l987. The development of surgical robots was envisioned to extend the capabilities of human surgeons beyond the limits of conventional laparoscopy. Others have documented in the literature the richness of the field in terms of various approaches to the development of surgical robots. However, it is only the Da Vinci that has received Food and Drug Administration approval as previously stated. The fact that no other robotic surgical system has been developed to serve as a competitor to the Da Vinci, and aggressive marketing of this technology, has created interesting disruptions in the field of robotic surgery and related minimally invasive surgery. Widespread use of the Da Vinci has occurred as a result of these aggressive marketing activities by this single-source vendor. This is especially true in urology for prostatectomies. Open radical retropubic prostatectomy has long been the most common surgical technique used to treat clinically localized prostate cancer.1 It is a highly complex procedure that requires intense surgical training dependent on graduated responsibility during training and a learning curve that approaches hundreds of cases.2 Before the anatomic descriptions of open radical prostatectomies, blood loss, transfusion rates, lengths of stay, and catheterization were concerns. In open surgery, highvolume surgeons practicing in high-volume hospitals are achieving benchmark outcomes.3 Robotic assisted radical prostatectomy has become popular among surgeons because of ease of pelvic access, high power magnification, and minimal bleeding during the operation. Features of the robotic technology that made it initially attractive in terms of performance of the procedure were the magnification and \u201cwristing\u201d that improved visualization and ergonomics for the surgeon. An improvement in urinary continence and potency recovery in comparison with open radical prostatectomy is the promise. Long-term data have confirmed the efficacy of radical prostatectomy, with disease control rates of 60% to 75% at 10 years and cancer-specific survival rates of 97% and 95% at 10 and 15 years, respectively.4 Even for patients with high-risk disease, cancer control rates at 10 years are 90% or greater. There has been a lack of well-controlled randomized trials of functional outcomes of robotic assisted radical prostatectomy compared with open radical prostatectomy to demonstrate superiority. Systematic reviews that control for surgical experience, institutional volume of surgery, and level of preoperative comorbidity plus surgical rehabilitation in patient-reported outcome assessment methods have been lacking. Retrospective analyses comprise the bulk of the literature that stands today. In complement to single institutional reviews, large population-based or administrative databases have been analyzed to provide additional information regarding complication rates, length of stay, cancer control, and long-term functional outcomes in addition to costs associated with adoption and diffusion of robotic assisted techniques. The Barbash et al5 article identifies internal and external factors associated with adoption of robotic surgical technology in US hospitals and the impact this has in terms of the yearly number of radical prostatectomy operations. The authors used administrative data from annual American Hospital Association surveys in terms of capital investment and reimbursement to analyze the impact on hospital volume of radical prostatectomy and adoption of robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. This analysis was carried out on hospitals and market areas from 2005 to 2009 and identified geographies where a high proportion of hospitals that acquired a robot would increase the likelihood of competing hospital in acquiring one. Multivariable analysis revealed that hospitals that had more than 300 beds, teaching hospitals, and hospitals with more private insurance patients lead to acquiring the robotic technology.

Robotic digital platforms potentially provide a solution to better address these challenges. This review examines the published literature on the outcomes and complications of bariatric surgery using a robotic platform. Use of robotics to perform adjustable gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy, roux-en-y gastric bypass (RYGB), biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch and revisional bariatric procedures (RBP) is assessed. A search on PubMed was performed for the most relevant articles in robotic bariatric surgery. A total of 23 articles was selected and reviewed in this article. The review showed that the use of robotics led to similar or lower complication rate in bariatric surgery when compared with laparoscopy. Two studies found a significantly lower leak rate for robotic gastric bypass when compared to laparoscopic method. The learning curve for RYGB seems to be shorter for robotic technique. Three studies revealed a significantly shorter operative time, while four studies found a longer operative time for robotic technique of gastric bypass. As for the outcomes of RBP, one study found a lower complication rate in robotic arm versus laparoscopic and open arms. Most authors stated that the use of robotics provides superior visualisation, more degrees of freedom and better ergonomics. The application of robotics in bariatric surgery seems to be a safe and feasible option. Use of robotics may provide specific advantages in some situations, and overcome limitations of laparoscopic surgery. Large and well-designed randomised clinical trials with long follow-up are needed to further define the role of digital platforms in bariatric surgery.","authors":"V. Bindal, P.

A prospective study.","abstract":"BACKGROUND\nRobotic-assisted total hip replacement has become a common method of implantation, especially in Europe. It frequently has been postulated that robotic reaming would result in an improved clinical outcome due to the better fit of the prosthesis, but that has never been demonstrated in a prospective study, to our knowledge. The purpose of this study was to compare robotic-assisted implantation of a total hip replacement with conventional manual implantation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOne hundred and fifty-four patients scheduled for total hip replacement were randomly assigned to undergo either conventional manual implantation of an S-ROM prosthesis (eighty patients) or robotic-assisted implantation of such a prosthesis (seventy-four patients). The five-axis ROBODOC was used for the robotic-assisted procedures. Preoperatively as well as at three, six, twelve, and twenty-four months after surgery, the scores according to the Harris and Merle d'Aubign\u00e9 systems and the Mayo clinical score were determined. Radiographs made at these intervals were analyzed for evidence of loosening, prosthetic alignment, and heterotopic ossification.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirteen (18%) of the seventy-four attempted robotic implantations had to be converted to manual implantations as a result of failure of the system. The duration of the robotic procedures was longer than that of the manual procedures (mean and standard deviation,107.1 +\/- 29.1 compared with 82.4 +\/- 23.4 minutes, p < 0.001). Limb-length equality (mean discrepancy, 0.18 +\/- 0.30 compared with 0.96 +\/- 0.93 cm, p < 0.001) and varus-valgus orientation of the stem (mean angle between the femur and the shaft of the prosthesis, 0.34 degrees +\/- 0.67 degrees compared with 0.84 degrees +\/- 1.23 degrees, p < 0.001) were better after the robotic procedures. At six months, slightly more heterotopic ossification was seen in the group treated with robotic implantation. The group treated with robotic implantation had a better Mayo clinical score at six and twelve months and a better Harris score at twelve months; however, by twenty-four months, no difference was found between the groups with regard to any of the three scores. Dislocation was more frequent in the group treated with robotic implantation: it occurred in eleven of the sixty-one patients in that group compared with three of eighty in the other group (p < 0.001). Recurrent dislocation and pronounced limping were indications for revision surgery in eight of the sixty-one patients treated with robotic implantation compared with none of the seventy-eight (excluding two with revision for infection) treated with manual insertion (p < 0.001). Rupture of the gluteus medius tendon was observed during all of the revision operations.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe robotic-assisted technology had advantages in terms of preoperative planning and the accuracy of the intraoperative procedure. Disadvantages were the high revision rate; the amount of muscle damage, which we believe was responsible for the higher dislocation rate; and the longer duration of surgery. This technology must be further developed before its widespread usage can be justified.","authors":"M. Honl, O. Dierk, C. Gauck, V. Carrero, F. Lampe, S. Dries, M. Quante, K. Schwieger, E. Hille, M.

There are several approaches for conducting hysterectomies, including abdominal, vaginal, laparoscopic and robotic. Recently, natural orifices transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) has emerged as an alternative approach for conducting hysterectomies. In this study, we aimed to compare the results of total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) and vaginally assisted-NOTES (vNOTES) hysterectomy procedures for the treatment of benign gynaecological diseases. Ninety-nine patients, who underwent conventional TLH or vNOTES hysterectomies, were included in this study. The operation time, presence of per\/postoperative complications, visual analogue scale (VAS) scores at postoperative sixth and 24th hours, and the duration of hospital stays were all analysed. The duration of surgery was significantly shorter in the vNOTES hysterectomy group (79.56\u2009\u00b1\u200932.54\u2009min) compared to the TLH group (120.67\u2009\u00b1\u200938.35\u2009min) (p: < .001). Also, postoperative hospital stays were significantly shorter in favour of the vNOTES hysterectomy group (44\u2009\u00b1\u200916.47\u2009h) compared to the TLH group (57.86\u2009\u00b1\u200921.31\u2009h) (p: .002). These results indicate that vNOTES hysterectomy can be a promising approach for treating a variety of different uterine pathologies and, furthermore, that it can be an alternative to TLH. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? A hysterectomy can be done in a variety of different ways, such as abdominal, laparoscopic, vaginal, and robotic. Even though the standard practice guidelines recommend that a vaginal hysterectomy (VH) should be the first choice of treatment, it can be challenging in cases of non-descendent and large uteruses. In such cases, NOTES hysterectomy can be an alternative option. What do the results of this study add? The study has shown that vNOTES is associated with a shorter operation and briefer postoperative hospitalisation time, in comparison to TLH. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and\/or further research? This study speculates that vNOTES is an approach which may offer better outcomes than a conventional laparoscopy. Further randomised controlled trials with larger sample sizes, however, should be conducted in order to establish the place of vNOTES in hysterectomy surgeries.","authors":"C. Kaya, Ismail Alay, H.

However, most studies have focused on degenerative disease. In this paper, the authors focus on metastatic spinal disease, which is associated with osteolysis. The associated lack of dense bone may potentially affect the automatic recognition accuracy of radiography-based surgical assistance systems. The aim of the present study is to compare the accuracy of the SpineAssist robot system with conventional fluoroscopy-guided pedicle screw placement for thoracolumbar metastatic spinal disease. METHODS Seventy patients with metastatic spinal disease who required instrumentation were included in this retrospective matched-cohort study. All 70 patients underwent surgery performed by the same team of experienced surgeons. The decision to use robot-assisted or fluoroscopy-guided pedicle screw placement was based the availability of the robot system. In patients who underwent surgery with robot guidance, pedicle screws were inserted after preoperative planning and intraoperative fluoroscopic matching. In the \"conventional\" group, anatomical landmarks and anteroposterior and lateral fluoroscopy guided placement of the pedicle screws. The primary outcome measure was the accuracy of screw placement on the Gertzbein-Robbins scale. Grades A and B (< 2-mm pedicle breach) were considered clinically acceptable, and all other grades indicated misplacement. Secondary outcome measures included an intergroup comparison of direction of screw misplacement, surgical site infection, and radiation exposure. RESULTS A total of 406 screws were placed at 206 levels. Sixty-one (29.6%) surgically treated levels were in the upper thoracic spine (T1-6), 74 (35.9%) were in the lower thoracic spine, and the remaining 71 (34.4%) were in the lumbosacral region. In the robot-assisted group (Group I; n = 35, 192 screws), trajectories were Grade A or B in 162 (84.4%) of screws. The misplacement rate was 15.6% (30 of 192 screws). In the conventional group (Group II; n = 35, 214 screws), 83.6% (179 of 214) of screw trajectories were acceptable, with a misplacement rate of 16.4% (35 of 214). There was no difference in screw accuracy between the groups (chi-square, 2-tailed Fisher's exact, p = 0.89). One screw misplacement in the fluoroscopy group required a second surgery (0.5%), but no revisions were required in the robot group. There was no difference in surgical site infections between the 2 groups (Group I, 5 patients [14.3%]; Group II, 8 patients [22.9%]) or in the duration of surgery between the 2 groups (Group I, 226.1 \u00b1 78.8 minutes; Group II, 264.1 \u00b1 124.3 minutes; p = 0.13). There was also no difference in radiation time between the groups (Group I, 138.2 \u00b1 73.0 seconds; Group II, 126.5 \u00b1 95.6 seconds; p = 0.61), but the radiation intensity was higher in the robot group (Group I, 2.8 \u00b1 0.2 mAs; Group II, 2.0 \u00b1 0.6 mAs; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Pedicle screw placement for metastatic disease in the thoracolumbar spine can be performed effectively and safely using robot-guided assistance. Based on this retrospective analysis, accuracy, radiation time, and postoperative infection rates are comparable to those of the conventional technique.","authors":"Volodymyr O.

Aim of the current study was to compare functional and oncologic outcomes of high-intensity focal ultrasound (HIFU) hemiablation of the prostate to robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) in the management of unilateral PCa.\n\n\nMATERIALS\nFifty-five men with unilateral, clinically localized PCa underwent HIFU hemiablation of the affected prostatic lobe between 2007 and 2015. All patients were found to have unilateral disease on the basis on full concordance between multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI-guided biopsies. These patients were matched 1:1 with patients who underwent RALP for PCa in which pT2a-b disease (unilateral) was found on final pathologic analysis. Matching criteria were Gleason score, prostate specific antigen (PSA), and cT stage. Treatment failure was defined as the need for salvage external beam radiotherapy or systemic androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) due to disease progression. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were constructed to assess differences in salvage treatment free survival across surgical techniques.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMatching was effective with no significant differences across the two groups, although men treated with HIFU were older (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Median follow-up was 36 months (interquartile range 16-56). HIFU was associated to better and faster recovery of continence, with most men (82%) showing no signs of urinary incontinence even right after surgery. Moreover, the risk of de novo erectile dysfunction was significantly lower after HIFU. No significant difference was found in the need for salvage external beam radiation therapy or ADT across the two surgical approaches: 7\/55 men underwent salvage therapy in the HIFU vs 6\/55 in the RALP group (p\u2009=\u20090.76). Nonetheless, seven more patients in the HIFU arm required a complementary treatment on the contralateral lobe during follow-up, after developing a contralateral PCa. No patient died of PCa on follow-up, while six men died of other causes (five HIFU vs one RALP, p\u2009=\u20090.11).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn this matched pair analysis, HIFU hemiablation was comparable to RALP in controlling localized unilateral PCa, with no significant differences in the need for salvage therapies. HIFU was also associated to significantly better functional outcomes. Accurate patient selection remains vital, and larger prospective trials are needed to confirm our findings.","authors":"S.

The present study was designed to compare robotic and laparoscopic distal gastrectomy in the treatment of gastric cancer.MethodsBetween June 2008 and September 2015, 41 laparoscopic and 30 robotic distal gastrectomies were performed by a single surgeon at the same institution. Clinicopathological characteristics of the patients, surgical performance, postoperative morbidity\/mortality and pathologic data were prospectively collected and compared between the laparoscopic and robotic groups by the Chi-square test and the Mann-Whitney test, as indicated.ResultsThere were no significant differences in patient characteristics between the two groups. Mean tumor size was larger in the laparoscopic than in the robotic patients (5.3 \u00b1 0.5 cm and 3.0 \u00b1 0.4 cm, respectively; P = 0.02). However, tumor stage distribution was similar between the two groups. The mean number of dissected lymph nodes was higher in the robotic than in the laparoscopic patients (39.1 \u00b1 3.7 and 30.5 \u00b1 2.0, respectively; P = 0.02). The mean operative time was 262.6 \u00b1 8.6 min in the laparoscopic group and 312.6 \u00b1 15.7 min in the robotic group (P < 0.001). The incidences of surgery-related and surgery-unrelated complications were similar in the laparoscopic and in the robotic patients. There were no significant differences in short-term clinical outcomes between the two groups.ConclusionsWithin the limitation of a small-sized, non-randomized analysis, our study confirms that robotic distal gastrectomy is a feasible and safe surgical procedure. When compared with conventional laparoscopy, robotic surgery shows evident benefits in the performance of lymphadenectomy with a higher number of retrieved and examined lymph nodes.","authors":"F.

Our aim was to clarify the safety and feasibility of using the HAL robotic suit for rehabilitation in patients with severe thoracic myelopathy due to ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (T-OPLL). Design: Uncontrolled case series; pre- and post-intervention measurement. Setting: In-patient rehabilitation unit. Intervention: HAL training was provided in 60-minuts session, 2\u20133 sessions per week, for a total of 10 sessions. HAL training was initiated on average 27.5 days post-surgery. Patients: Eight patients (four males and four females; mean age, 60.9\u2009\u00b1\u200910.2 years) with severe myelopathy, who had undergone posterior decompression with instrumented fusion, were enrolled. Outcome Measures: Gait speed, step length and cadence were measured along a 10-m walkway every session. The American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor score (lower extremities) and Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury (WISCI) II were also evaluated at baseline and after 10 sessions. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score was calculated over time after surgery. Results: All participants completed the 10 training sessions, with no serious adverse effect noted. Gait speed, step length and cadence improved over time. Both the WISCI-II and ASIA motor (lower extremities) scores improved from baseline after 10 sessions. The JOA score improved over time post-surgery. Conclusion: HAL training can be feasibly initiated in the early postoperative period, without severe adverse events in patients, with T-OPLL-related severe gait disturbance.","authors":"S. Kubota, T.

It draws attention to the complexities with teamwork, intraoperative communication and disruptions during robotic-assisted and laparoscopic surgeries. Although robotic-assisted surgery is generally seen as safe and effective, this review highlights the need for education and training that focuses on non-technical skills development, disruption prevention and alertness in anticipating and minimising risk.\n\n\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE\nThe evidence from this review identifies the different demands and diverse challenges in maintaining safety during robotic-assisted and laparoscopic surgery. Although specific technical knowledge and skills are essential, this review highlights the importance of developing new ways of thinking with regard to assessment and management of disruptions, developing different teamwork patterns and communication skills, and overcoming challenges introduced during technology advanced surgeries. Nurses in the perioperative setting have an increased responsibility to continue professional development and remain vigilant to factors affecting patient safety. Early identification and management of factors leading to disruptions is imperative in the provision of safe perioperative care.","authors":"R. Mathew, K. Markey, J. Murphy, B. O.

Human papillomavirus-associated OPSCC affects younger patients and often presents at a higher stage; however, it is associated with a better prognosis.Until recently, first-line management of OPSCC involved chemoradiotherapy, as research had demonstrated comparable survival outcomes when compared with open surgery, with significantly decreased morbidity. However, interventions have now evolved with computerised planning and intensity-modulated radiotherapy, and the advent of endoscopic head and neck surgery, which provide the potential for decreased treatment-associated morbidity.The oropharynx plays an essential role in swallowing, speech and protecting the airway as it is situated at the bifurcation of the respiratory and digestive tracts. Treatment modality recommendations are based on survival outcomes. Given the younger patient demographic, establishing the safety of modalities that potentially have better functional outcome is becoming increasingly important.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the efficacy of endoscopic head and neck surgery (transoral robotic surgery or transoral laser microsurgery) for small-volume, primary (T1-2, N0-2) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) in comparison to radiotherapy\/chemoradiotherapy.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nThe Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 10); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 8 November 2016.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised controlled trials in patients with carcinoma in the oropharynx subsite (as defined by the World Health Organization classification C09, C10). Cancers included were primary squamous cell carcinomas arising from the oropharyngeal mucosa. The tumours were classified as T1-T2 with or without nodal disease and with no evidence of distant metastatic spread. The intervention was transoral, minimally invasive surgery with or without adjuvant radiotherapy or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The comparator was primary radiotherapy with or without induction or concurrent chemotherapy for the tumour. The treatments received and compared were of curative intent and patients had not undergone prior intervention, other than diagnostic biopsy.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nWe used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were overall survival (disease-related mortality was to be studied where possible), locoregional control, disease-free survival and progression-free survival or time to recurrence. All outcomes were to be measured at two, three and five years after diagnosis. Our secondary outcomes included quality of life, harms associated with treatment, patient satisfaction and xerostomia score.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nNo completed studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. Two ongoing trials fulfilled the selection criteria, however neither are complete.'Early-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx: radiotherapy versus trans-oral robotic surgery (ORATOR)' is a phase II randomised controlled trial comparing primary radiation therapy with primary transoral robotic surgery for small-volume primary (T1-2, N0-2) OPSCC. It is currently in progress with an estimated completion date of June 2021.'European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 1420 (EORTC 1420-HNCG-ROG)' is a phase III, randomised study assessing the \"best of\" radiotherapy compared to transoral robotic surgery\/transoral laser microsurgery in patients with T1-T2, N0 squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and base of tongue. It was due to start accrual mid-2016.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThe role of endoscopic head and neck surgery in the management of OPSCC is clearly expanding as evidenced by its more overt incorporation into the current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Data are mounting regarding its outcomes both in terms of survival and lower morbidity. As confidence increases, it is being used in the management of more advanced OPSCC.Based on this review, there is currently no high-quality evidence from randomised controlled trials regarding clinical outcomes for patients with oropharyngeal cancer receiving endoscopic head and neck surgery compared with primary chemoradiotherapy.","authors":"James E F Howard, L.

Furthermore, there are no significant differences between laparoscopic surgery and open surgery with respect to the long-term outcomes in colon cancer. Thus, laparoscopic surgery has been accepted as one of the standard treatments for colon cancer. In addition, laparoscopic surgery has also achieved favorable outcomes in the treatments of rectal cancer, with many reports showing long-term outcomes comparable to those of open surgery. Furthermore, the magnification in laparoscopy improves visualization in the pelvic cavity and facilitates precise manipulation, as well as providing an excellent educational opportunity. Laparoscopic surgery may be an ideal approach for the treatment of rectal cancer and colon cancer. Recently, two trials showed that, among patients with advanced rectal cancer, the use of laparoscopic surgery as compared with open surgery confirmed to meet the criterion for non-inferiority for long-term outcomes.

To our knowledge, there have been no published reports directly comparing the oncologic and functional outcomes of patients with recurrent oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) treated with transoral robotic-assisted surgery (TORS) with those treated with traditional open surgical approaches.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo compare the oncologic and functional outcomes of patients with recurrent oropharyngeal SCC treated with TORS with those treated with traditional open surgical approaches.\n\n\nDESIGN\nRetrospective multi-institutional case-control study; study dates, March 2003 through October 2011.\n\n\nSETTING\nFour tertiary care institutions (University of Alabama at Birmingham; M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas; Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota; and Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, Michigan). PARTICIPANTS Sixty-four patients who underwent salvage TORS for recurrent oropharyngeal SCC were matched by TNM stage to 64 patients who underwent open salvage resection. INTERVENTION OR EXPOSURE: Salvage TORS for recurrent SCC of the oropharynx.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES\nPatient demographics, operative data, functional, and oncologic outcomes were recorded and compared with a similarly TNM-matched patient group that underwent salvage surgical resection by traditional open surgical approaches. RESULTS Patients treated with TORS were found to have a significantly lower incidence of tracheostomy use (n = 14 vs n\u2009=\u200950; P\u2009<\u2009.001), feeding tube use (n\u2009=\u200923 vs n =\u200948; P <\u2009.001), shorter overall hospital stays (3.8 days vs 8.0 days; P <\u2009.001), decreased operative time (111 minutes vs 350 minutes; P <\u2009.001), less blood loss (49 mL vs 331 mL; P <\u2009.001), and significantly decreased incidence of positive margins (n\u2009=\u20096 vs n\u2009=\u200919; P\u2009=\u2009.007). The 2-year recurrence-free survival rate was significantly higher in the TORS group than in the open approach group (74% and 43%, respectively) (P =\u2009.01).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nThis study demonstrates that TORS offers an alternative surgical approach to recurrent tumors of the oropharynx with acceptable oncologic outcomes and better functional outcomes than traditional open surgical approaches. This adds to the growing amount of clinical evidence to support the use of TORS in selected patients with recurrent oropharyngeal SCC as a feasible and oncologically sound method of treatment.","authors":"Hilliary N.

The aim of this study was to report the long-term oncological results of the ROBOT trial in terms of survival and disease-free survival. This study is a follow-up study of the ROBOT trial, which was a randomized controlled trial comparing RAMIE to OTE in 112 patients with intrathoracic esophageal cancer. Both the trial protocol and short-term results were previously published. The primary outcome of the current study was 5-year overall survival. Secondary outcomes were disease-free survival and recurrence patterns. Analysis was by intention to treat. During the recruitment period, 109 patients were included in the survival analysis (RAMIE n\u2009=\u200954, OTE n\u2009=\u200955). Majority of patients had clinical stage III or IV (RAMIE 63%, OTE 55%) and received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (80%). Median follow-up was 60\u00a0months (range 31-60). The combined 5-year overall survival rates for RAMIE and OTE were 41% (95% CI 27-55) and 40% (95% CI 26-53), respectively (log rank test P\u2009=\u20090.827). The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 42% (95% CI 28-55) in the RAMIE group and 43% (95% CI 29-57) in the OTE group (log rank test P\u2009=\u20090.749). Out of 104 patients, 57 (55%) developed recurrent disease detected at a median of 10\u00a0months (range 0-56) after surgery. No statistically difference in recurrence rate nor recurrence pattern was observed between both groups. Overall survival and disease-free survival of RAMIE are comparable to OTE.

Baseline characteristics, perioperative and pathologic variables, and continence data at 3 months after surgery were retrospectively reviewed from a prospectively maintained database. Categoric and continuous variables were compared using chi-square, Student t, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, as appropriate.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 29 patients underwent laparoscopic RP using a 3D display system and 66 patients underwent laparoscopic RP using a 2D display system. The two groups were comparable for all clinical and pathologic variables. Mean total operative time for the 3D group was 131 minutes (standard deviation [SD]\u00b118) compared with 190 (SD\u00b131) for the 2D group (P<0.001). Mean time to perform the urethrovesical anastomosis was 28 minutes (SD\u00b16) for the 3D group compared with 87 minutes (SD\u00b117) for the 2D group (P<0.001). Blood loss was lower in the 3D group, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.001). A statistically significant higher number of patients in the 3D group had early recovery of continence compared with patients in the 2D group (14\/28 (50%) patients in the 3D group vs 16\/64 (25%) patients in the 2D group, P=0.02).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLaparoscopic RP aided by a new-generation 3D display system is associated with shorter operative times, reduced blood loss, and higher early continence rates in comparison with that aided by a 2D display system. In particular when considering economic issues, 3D laparoscopic RP may represent an acceptable alternative to robot-assisted laparoscopic RP.","authors":"S. Aykan, P. Singhal, D. Nguyen, A. Yigit, M.

Standard procedures use 2D radiographs to estimate the desired reduction position of bone fragments. However, optimal correction in a 3D space requires 3D imaging. This paper introduces a new navigation system that uses pre-operative planning based on 3D CT data and intra-operative 3D guidance to virtually reduce lower-limb intra-articular fractures. Physical reduction in the fractures is then performed by our robotic system based on the virtual reduction.Methods3D models of bone fragments are segmented from CT scan. Fragments are pre-operatively visualized on the screen and virtually manipulated by the surgeon through a dedicated GUI to achieve the virtual reduction in the fracture. Intra-operatively, the actual position of the bone fragments is provided by an optical tracker enabling real-time 3D guidance. The motion commands for the robot connected to the bone fragment are generated, and the fracture physically reduced based on the surgeon\u2019s virtual reduction. To test the system, four femur models were fractured to obtain four different distal femur fracture types. Each one of them was subsequently reduced 20 times by a surgeon using our system.ResultsThe navigation system allowed an orthopaedic surgeon to virtually reduce the fracture with a maximum residual positioning error of $$0.95 \\pm 0.3\\,\\hbox {mm}$$0.95\u00b10.3mm (translational) and $$1.4^{\\circ } \\pm 0.5^{\\circ }$$1.4\u2218\u00b10.5\u2218 (rotational).

From January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2010, a total of 1290 patients with a mean (SD) age of 57 (11) years underwent mitral valve repair for regurgitation from posterior leaflet prolapse. Robotically assisted surgery was performed in 473 patients, complete sternotomy in 227, partial sternotomy in 349, and anterolateral thoracotomy in 241. Comparisons were based on intent to treat, with 3 propensity-matched groups formed based on demographics, symptoms, cardiac and noncardiac comorbidities, valve pathophysiologic disorders, and echocardiographic measurements: robotic vs sternotomy (198 pairs) vs partial sternotomy (293 pairs) vs thoracotomy (224 pairs).\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nMitral valve repair.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nCost of care (expressed as robotic capital investment, maintenance of equipment, and direct technical hospital costs) and benefit of care (based on differences in recovery time).\n\n\nRESULTS\nCost of care (median [15th and 85th percentiles]) for robotically assisted surgery exceeded that of alternative approaches by 26.8% (-5.3% and 67.9%), 32.1% (-6.1% and 69.6%), and 20.7% (-2.4% and 48.4%) for complete sternotomy, partial sternotomy, and anterolateral thoracotomy, respectively. Higher operative costs were partially offset by lower postoperative costs and earlier return to work: a median (15th and 85th percentiles) of 35 (19 and 63) days for robotically assisted surgery, 49 (21 and 109) days for complete sternotomy, 56 (30 and 119) days for partial sternotomy, and 42 (18 and 90) days for anterolateral thoracotomy. Resulting net differences (median [15th and 85th percentiles]) in the cost of robotic surgery vs the 3 alternatives were 15.6% (-14.7% and 55.1%), 15.7% (-19.4% and 51.2%), and 14.8% (-7.4% and 43.6%), respectively. Beyond a volume threshold of 55 to 100 robotically assisted operations per year, distribution of the cost of this technology broadly overlapped those of conventional approaches.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nIn exchange for higher procedural costs, robotically assisted surgery for mitral valve repair offers the clinical benefit of least-invasive surgery, lowest postoperative cost, and fastest return to work. The value of robotically assisted surgery that is similar to that of conventional approaches can be realized only in high-volume centers.","authors":"T. Mihaljevic, M.

The development of robotic technology has facilitated the application of minimally invasive techniques for complex gynecologic surgery. Robot-assisted gynecologic surgery has grown exponentially since receiving Food and Drug Administration approval for use in gynecologic surgery in 2005. Robotic surgery has several major advantages, including three-dimensional visual magnification, articulation beyond normal manipulation, and the filtering of the operator\u2019s hand tremors. Therefore, robotic surgery is suitable for microsurgery, and it could be an alternative option for laparotomy. Robotic surgery has advantages, especially for suture-intensive operations such as myomectomy. Patients who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic myomectomy had significantly decreased estimated blood loss, complication rates, and length of hospital stay. The advantages of robotic surgery help to overcome the limitations of laparoscopy, especially for complicated procedures in deep infiltrating endometriosis. Although extensive radical operations for deep infiltrating endometriosis of the bowel and urinary tract, such as segmental resections of the bladder, ureters, and bowel, were performed by laparotomy in the past, they are now performed more easily and more effectively using robotic techniques. In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis, robotic and laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy resulted in similar clinical outcomes, but robotic surgery was associated with a longer operation time and higher costs. Robotic and conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy show equivalent surgical and clinical outcomes. Compared to laparotomy, robotic gynecologic cancer surgery results in improved clinical outcomes and comparable oncologic outcomes. If robotic surgery is tailored in terms of patient selection, surgeon ability, and equipment availability, it could be a feasible option for highly advanced minimally invasive surgery.","authors":"Youn-Jee Chung, Mee-Ran Kim","year":2019,"url":"https:\/\/www.semanticscholar.org\/paper\/9e7afee178153c3311f08903e08432aca57465ec"},{"title":"Subjective and objective results 1 year after robotic sacrocolpopexy using a lightweight Y-mesh","abstract":"Introduction and hypothesisThe objective of this study was to assess outcomes following robotic sacrocolpopexy using a lightweight polypropylene Y-mesh.MethodsDuring our study period, all patients who underwent robotic sacrocolpopexy were enrolled in this single-arm prospective trial.

The primary outcome measure was the accuracy of screw placement according to the Gertzbein-Robbins scale; grades A and B (pedicle breach < 2 mm) were considered clinically acceptable. In the RG, discrepancies between the planned and actual screw placements were measured by merging postoperative CT images with the trajectory planning images. Secondary outcome parameters included proximal facet joint violation, duration of surgery, intraoperative blood loss, conversion to freehand approach in the RG, postoperative hospital stay, and radiation exposure.RESULTSA total of 1116 pedicle screws were implanted in 234 patients (119 in the FG, and 115 in the RG). In the RG, 95.3% of the screws were perfectly positioned (grade A); the remaining screws were graded B (3.4%), C (0.9%), and D (0.4%). In the FG, 86.1% screws were perfectly positioned (grade A); the remaining screws were graded B (7.4%), C (4.6%), D (1.4%), and E (0.5%). The proportion of clinically acceptable screws was significantly greater in the RG than in the FG (p < 0.01). In the RG, the mean deviation was 1.5 \u00b1 0.8 mm for each screw. The most common direction of screw deviation was lateral in the RG and medial in the FG. Two misplaced screws in the FG required revision surgery, whereas no revision was required in the RG. None of the screws in the RG violated the proximal facet joint, whereas 12 screws (2.1%) in the FG violated the proximal facet joint (p < 0.01). The RG had significantly less blood loss (186.0 \u00b1 255.3 ml) than the FG (217.0 \u00b1 174.3 ml; p < 0.05).

In head and neck oncology the surgical therapy is one of the key pillars in curative treatment. The standardized surgical techniques are supplemented and improved by the application of technical devices. The ambition is the reduction in peri- and postoperative morbidity, hospitalization time, and the enhancement of functional outcome. In other surgical specialties, the application of robotics is widely seen as standard. The purpose of this review is to outline the current status of robotics in head and neck surgery in the context of the present literature, to demonstrate reasonable application fields, and to discuss the expenditure of the usage of such tools. Furthermore, this review offers an overview of current research in this field. Abstract Background. In the past few years, surgical robots have recently entered the medical field, particularly in urology, gynecology, and general surgery. However, the clinical effectiveness and safety of robot-assisted surgery (RAS) in the field of head and neck surgery has not been clearly established. In this review, we evaluate to what extent RAS can potentially be applied in head and neck surgery, in which fields it is already daily routine and what advantages can be seen in comparison to conventional surgery. Data sources. For this purpose, we conducted a systematic review of trials published between 2000 and 2021, as well as currently ongoing trials registered in clinicaltrials.gov. The results were structured according to anatomical regions, for the topics \u201cCosts,\u201d \u201ccurrent clinical trials,\u201d and \u201crobotic research\u201d we added separate sections for the sake of clarity. Results. Our findings show a lack of large-scale systematic randomized trials on the use of robots in head and neck surgery. Most studies include small case series or lack a control arm which enables a comparison with established standard procedures. Conclusion. The question of financial reimbursement is still not answered and the systems on the market still require some specific improvements for the use in head and neck surgery.","authors":"F. Boehm, R.

In a large proportion of patients, disease recurrence is clinically localized and therefore potentially curable. Unfortunately, due to the complex and potentially morbid nature of salvage treatment, radical salvage surgery is uncommonly performed. In an attempt to decrease the morbidity of salvage therapy without sacrificing oncologic efficacy, a number of experienced centers have utilized robotic assistance to perform minimally invasive salvage radical prostatectomy. Herein, we critically evaluate the existing literature on salvage robotic radical prostatectomy with a focus on patient selection, perioperative complications and functional and early oncologic outcomes. These results are compared with contemporary and historical open salvage radical prostatectomy series and supplemented with insights we have gained from our experience with salvage robotic radical prostatectomy. The body of evidence by which conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of robotic salvage radical prostatectomy can be drawn comprises fewer than 200 patients with limited follow-up. Preliminary results are promising and some outcomes have been favorable when compared with contemporary open salvage prostatectomy series. Advantages of the robotic platform in the performance of salvage radical prostatectomy include decreased blood loss, short length of stay and improved visualization. Greater experience is required to confirm the long-term oncologic efficacy and functional outcomes as well as the generalizability of results achieved at experienced centers.","authors":"S.

Herein, we evaluated the level of experience of the bedside assistant and its impact on perioperative outcomes in RAPN.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nAll RAPN cases in our healthcare system from January 2011 to December 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. The cases were divided into teaching and nonteaching hospitals. There were 18 fellowship-trained attending surgeons. At teaching hospitals, surgeries were performed by an attending physician and postgraduate year (PGY)-2 or PGY-3 resident at bedside; at nonteaching hospitals, surgeries were performed by two attending surgeons. We compared age, gender, body mass index, Charlson comorbidity index, operative difficulty by R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score, and operative outcomes (WIT, estimated blood loss, operative time (OT), positive margin rate, length of stay (LOS), postoperative glomerular filtration rate, and readmission rate).\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 170 patients captured, 162 had R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score and WIT: 112 from teaching hospitals and 50 from nonteaching hospitals.

The expected benefits of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) mainly include reductions of postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, and pain and better cosmetic results. All of these benefits could potentially be of great interest when dealing with the esophagus due to the potentially severe complications that can occur after conventional surgery. Moreover, robotic platforms are expected to reduce many of the difficulties encountered during advanced laparoscopic and thoracoscopic procedures such as anastomotic reconstructions, accurate lymphadenectomies, and vascular sutures. Almost all esophageal diseases are approachable in a minimally invasive way, including diverticula, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, achalasia, perforations and cancer. Nevertheless, while the limits of MIS for benign esophageal diseases are mainly technical issues and costs, oncologic outcomes remain the cornerstone of any procedure to cure malignancies, for which the long-term results are critical. Furthermore, many of the minimally invasive esophageal operations should be compared to pharmacologic interventions and advanced pure endoscopic procedures; such a comparison requires a difficult literature analysis and leads to some confounding results of clinical trials. This review aims to examine the evidence for the use of MIS in both malignancies and more common benign disease of the esophagus, with a particular emphasis on future developments and ongoing areas of research.","authors":"L.

Despite a long history of clinical research and development of high-tech staplers, this procedure is still feared by most surgeons and associated with a 10% leakage rate. Among specific factors that may contribute to failure of the esophageal anastomosis are the absence of serosa layer, longitudinal orientation of muscle fibers, and ischemia of the gastric conduit. It has recently been suggested that the gut microbiome may influence the healing process of the anastomosis through the presence of collagenolytic bacterial strains, indicating that suture breakdown is not only a matter of collagen biosynthesis. The esophagogastric anastomosis can be performed either in the chest or neck, and can be completely hand-sewn, completely stapled (circular or linear stapler), or semi-mechanical (linear stapler posterior wall and hand-sewn anterior wall). Because of the lack of randomized clinical trials, no conclusive evidence is available, and the debate between the hand-sewn and the stapling technique is still ongoing even in the present era of robotic surgery. Centralization of care has improved the overall postoperative outcomes of esophagectomy, but the esophagogastric anastomosis remains the Achille\u2019s heel of the procedure. More research and network collaboration of experts is needed to improve safety and clinical outcomes.","authors":"L.

Karel Capek first used the term in his 1921 play Rossum\u2019s Universal Robots, in which robots were a series of factory-manufactured artificial people made from synthetic material that undertook mundane tasks for their human masters. The robots eventually became frustrated with their roles and masterminded a robotic rebellion, leading to the extinction of the human race. Since then, robotics has evolved to describe an array of computer machines that perform preprogrammed, precise, and repetitive procedures. These computer machines have now become integrated into the routine workforce of several industries, including aviation, military, healthcare, finance, construction, and engineering.1,2 Robotic technology has helped each of these sectors to achieve and sustain levels of precision, productivity, and efficiency that were not possible with humans alone. Within each of these sectors that have integrated robotic technology into the workforce, the use of this technology has never diminished or exited from the industry.2 The first robotic surgical procedure was performed by Kwoh et al3 in 1988 using the PUMA 560 robotic system (Westinghouse Electric, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) to undertake neurosurgical biopsies with improved precision. The same robotic platform was used by Davies et al4 in 1991 to undertake transurethral resections of the prostate with greater accuracy and reduced iatrogenic soft-tissue injury. over the following two decades, several other surgical robotic devices were developed, including the Zeus (Computer Motion, Inc., Goleta, California) and Da vinci (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, California) robotic platforms, which enabled a variety of surgical procedures to be performed remotely using robotically controlled arms and a 3D camera to improve the visual field.5,6 These robotic devices have been used to perform cholecystectomy, hysterectomy, lobectomy, mitral valve replacement, coronary artery bypass grafting, and prostatectomy. Compared with conventional open surgery or laparoscopic surgery, robotic surgery with these devices is associated with smaller skin incisions, improved precision of soft-tissue dissection, better visualization of the surgical field, and more comprehensive data capture for surgical training.6,7 Clinically, this has translated to robotic surgery enabling faster postoperative rehabilitation and decreased length of hospital stay compared with conventional and laparoscopic surgery for these procedures.5-8 Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is an effective and cost-efficient procedure that is performed in over 90 000 patients per year in the United Kingdom.9 Implant survivorship, assessed with revision as the primary endpoint, is greater than 90% at ten years\u2019 follow-up.10,11 However, patient satisfaction and functional outcomes remain inferior to total hip arthroplasty, with up to 20% of patients remaining dissatisfied following TKA.12,13 Accurate implant positioning, balanced flexionextension gaps, proper ligament tensioning, and preservation of the periarticular soft-tissue envelope are important surgeon-controlled variables that affect functional outcomes, implant stability, and long-term implant survivorship.14-16 Conventional jig-based TKA uses preoperative radiographic films, intraoperative anatomical landmarks, and manually positioned alignment jigs to guide bone resection and implant positioning. However, these handheld techniques are associated with poor reproducibility of alignment-guide positioning, inadvertent sawblade injury to the periarticular soft-tissue envelope, and limited intraoperative data on gap measurements or ligamentous tensioning to Robotic total knee arthroplasty","authors":"B.

We aimed to review the literature on this topic, combined with personal experiences, so as to give recommendations on how to avoid and manage this complication. Methods We performed a narrative review on bowel injury following gynecological laparoscopic surgery using PubMed covering prevention, diagnosis, and management. Search terms used were laparoscopy, gynaecology, injury, bowel, prevention, treatment. Results Important principles of prevention include proper pre-operative evaluation and increased laparoscopic surgical skills and knowledge. High clinical suspicion is crucial for early diagnosis. Diagnostic workup of suspected cases includes serial abdominal examination, measuring inflammatory markers, and performing imaging studies including abdominal ultrasound and CT scan. When bowel injury is recognized during the first laparoscopic procedure then laparoscopic primary suturing could be tried although laparotomy may be needed. When diagnosis is delayed, then laparotomy is the treatment of choice. The role of robotic surgery and three-dimensional laparoscopic gynecological surgery on bowel injury needs to be further assessed. Conclusion Early recognition of bowel injury is crucial for a favorable clinical outcome. A combined collaboration between gynecologists and general surgeons is important for timely and proper decisions to be made.","authors":"H. Elbiss, F.

Limited evidence is currently available on the role of robotics in the field of radical nephrectomy. The aim of the current study was to provide a systematic review of the current evidence on the role of robotic radical nephrectomy (RRN) and to analyze the comparative studies between RRN and open nephrectomy (ON)\/LRN.MethodsA Medline search was performed between 2000\u20132013 with the terms \u201crobotic radical nephrectomy\u201d, \u201crobot-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy\u201d, \u201cradical nephrectomy\u201d. Six RRN case-series and four comparative studies between RRN and (ON)\/pure or hand-assisted LRN were identified.ResultsCurrent literature produces a low level of evidence for RRN in the treatment of RCC, with only one prospective study available. Mean operative time (OT) ranges between 127.8-345\u00a0min, mean estimated blood loss (EBL) ranges between 100\u2013273.6\u00a0ml, and mean hospital stay (HS) ranges between 1.2-4.3\u00a0days. The comparison between RRN and LRN showed no differences in the evaluated outcomes except for a longer OT for RRN as evidenced in two studies. Significantly higher direct costs and costs of the disposable instruments were also observed for RRN. The comparison between RRN and ON showed that ON is characterized by shorter OT but higher EBL, higher need of postoperative analgesics and longer HS.ConclusionsNo advantage of robotics over standard laparoscopy for the treatment of clinically localized RCC was evidenced.

Over the last decade, robot-assisted surgery has become more commonly used as a minimally invasive approach for reconstructive upper urinary tract procedures. The aim of this study is to present our experience with robot-assisted ureteroneocystosctomy (RUNC) with a comparison with that of open ureteroneocystostomy (OUNC).\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nMedical records of 25 patients who underwent RUNC and 41 patients who underwent OUNC or at our institution between 2000 and 2010 were retrospectively analyzed. Perioperative and postoperative data including demographics, surgical outcomes, and clinical and radiographic findings at postoperative follow-up were considered in the comparative analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to present the data. The significance of the difference between variables was evaluated using the Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous and Fisher exact test for categorical variables.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo significant differences were detected in terms of baseline patient characteristics between the two groups. The OUNC procedures were performed with a shorter median operative time (200 vs 279 min., P=0.0008), whereas RUNC patients had a shorter hospital stay (median 3 vs 5 days, P=0.0004), less narcotic pain requirement (morphine equivalent, mg 104.6 vs 290, P=0.0001), and less estimated blood loss (100 vs 150 mL, P=<0.0002). There as no significant difference in the rate of reoperation between groups: RUNC 2\/25 (7.6 %) vs OUNC 4\/41 (9.7%) P=0.8. Limitations include the retrospective nature of the study and the difference in indications for surgery.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nRUNC provides excellent outcomes with shorter hospital stay, less narcotic pain requirement, and decreased blood loss when compared with the open procedure. Advantages of the robotic platform for dissection and suturing can be useful for complex minimally invasive urologic reconstructive procedures.","authors":"Wahib Isac, J. Kaouk, F.

Surgery remains the main method of managing early-stage disease. Minimal-access video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery results in less tissue trauma than open surgery; however, it is not known if it improves patient outcomes.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy with open surgery for the treatment of lung cancer.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS\nA multicentre, superiority, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial with blinding of participants (until hospital discharge) and outcome assessors conducted in nine NHS hospitals. Adults referred for lung resection for known or suspected lung cancer, with disease suitable for both surgeries, were eligible. Participants were followed up for 1 year.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nParticipants were randomised 1\u2009:\u20091 to video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy or open surgery. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery used one to four keyhole incisions without rib spreading. Open surgery used a single incision with rib spreading, with or without rib resection.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was self-reported physical function (using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30) at 5 weeks. Secondary outcomes included upstaging to pathologic node stage 2 disease, time from surgery to hospital discharge, pain in the first 2 days, prolonged pain requiring analgesia at >\u20095 weeks, adverse health events, uptake of adjuvant treatment, overall and disease-free survival, quality of life (Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30, Quality of Life Questionnaire Lung Cancer 13 and EQ-5D) at 2 and 5 weeks and 3, 6 and 12 months, and cost-effectiveness.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 503 patients were randomised between July 2015 and February 2019 (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, n\u2009=\u2009247; open surgery, n\u2009=\u2009256). One participant withdrew before surgery. The mean age of patients was 69 years; 249 (49.5%) patients were men and 242 (48.1%) did not have a confirmed diagnosis. Lobectomy was performed in 453 of 502 (90.2%) participants and complete resection was achieved in 429 of 439 (97.7%) participants. Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 physical function was better in the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery group than in the open-surgery group at 5 weeks (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, n\u2009=\u2009247; open surgery, n\u2009=\u2009255; mean difference 4.65, 95% confidence interval 1.69 to 7.61; p\u2009=\u20090.0089). Upstaging from clinical node stage 0 to pathologic node stage 1 and from clinical node stage 0 or 1 to pathologic node stage 2 was similar (p\u2009\u2265\u20090.50). Pain scores were similar on day 1, but lower in the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery group on day 2 (mean difference -0.54, 95% confidence interval -0.99 to -0.09; p\u2009=\u20090.018). Analgesic consumption was 10% lower (95% CI -20% to 1%) and the median hospital stay was less (4 vs. 5 days, hazard ratio 1.34, 95% confidence interval 1.09, 1.65; p\u2009=\u20090.006) in the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery group than in the open-surgery group. Prolonged pain was also less (relative risk 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.72 to 0.94; p\u2009=\u20090.003). Time to uptake of adjuvant treatment, overall survival and progression-free survival were similar (p\u2009\u2265\u20090.28). Fewer participants in the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery group than in the open-surgery group experienced complications before and after discharge from hospital (relative risk 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 0.84; p\u2009<\u20090.001 and relative risk 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 1.00; p\u2009=\u20090.053, respectively). Quality of life to 1 year was better across several domains in the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery group than in the open-surgery group. The probability that video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery is cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of \u00a320,000 per quality-adjusted life-year is 1.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS\nEthnic minorities were under-represented compared with the UK population (<\u20095%), but the cohort reflected the lung cancer population.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nVideo-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy was associated with less pain, fewer complications and better quality of life without any compromise to oncologic outcome.

The hybrid assistive limb (HAL) is a new robot suit controlling knee and hip joint motion by detecting very weak bioelectric signals on the surface of the skin. This study is to report the feasibility and benefits of patient-assistive HAL walking rehabilitation for facilitating locomotor function after spinal surgery. The patient was a 60-year-old woman with thoracic OPLL, and her motor and sensory paralyses did not improve after spinal surgery, indicating severe impairment in the paretic legs. The subject underwent 6 HAL sessions per week for 8 weeks, consisting of a standing and sitting exercise and walking on the ground with HAL. Clinical outcomes were evaluated before and after HAL training and 1 year after surgery. The subject improved considerably as a result of HAL training. Subsequently, her walking ability recovered rapidly, and she was able to walk unaided six months after surgery. This case study suggests that HAL training is a feasible and effective option to facilitating locomotor function and the early HAL training with physiotherapy may enhance motor recovery of patients with residual paralysis after surgery.","authors":"H.

Until the 1990s, open surgery was the primary treatment for OPSCC. However, due to the potentially severe functional morbidity of this approach, open surgery was largely displaced by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in the 1990s. At the same time, new, less-invasive surgical approaches such as transoral surgery with monopolar cautery began to emerge, with the potential to reduce functional morbidity and avoid the late-onset toxicity of CRT. More recently, the growing incidence of HPV-positive disease has altered the patient profile of OPSCC, as these patients tend to be younger and have a better long-term prognosis. Consequently, this has further bolstered interest in minimally-invasive techniques to de-intensify treatment to reduce long-term toxicity and treatment-related morbidity. In this context, there has been a renewed interest in the primary surgery, which allows for accurate pathologic staging and thus\u2014potentially\u2014de-intensification of postoperative CRT. The continuous advances in minimally-invasive surgical approaches, including transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) and transoral robotic surgery (TORS), have also altered the surgical landscape. These minimally-invasive approaches offer excellent functional outcomes, without the severe toxicity associated with intensive CRT, thus substantially reducing treatment-related morbidity. In short, given the increasing prevalence of HPV-positive OPSCC, together with the severe long-term sequela of aggressive CRT, surgery appears to be recapturing its previous role as the primary treatment modality for this disease. While a growing body of evidence suggests that TLM and TORS offer oncologic outcomes that are comparable to CRT and open surgery, many questions remain due to the lack of prospective data. In the present review, we explore the emerging range of surgical options and discuss future directions in the treatment of OPSCC, including the most relevant clinical trials currently underway.","authors":"W.

Studies have relied primarily on evaluation of clinical outcomes and medical expenses. Thus, a paucity of information on patient-reported outcomes including satisfaction, recovery, and recommendations exists. Objective The objective of this study was to identify differences in patient satisfaction and recommendations by approach to a hysterectomy. Methods We recruited a large, geographically diverse group of women who were members of an online hysterectomy support community. US women who had undergone a benign hysterectomy formed this retrospective study cohort. Self-reported characteristics and experiences were compared by surgical modality using chi-square tests. Outcomes over time were assessed with the Jonkheere-Terpstra trend test. Logistic regression identified independent predictors of patient satisfaction and recommendations. Results There were 6262 women who met the study criteria; 41.74% (2614\/6262) underwent an abdominal hysterectomy, 10.64% (666\/6262) were vaginal, 27.42% (1717\/6262) laparoscopic, 18.94% (1186\/6262) robotic, and 1.26% (79\/6262) single-incision laparoscopic. Most women were at least college educated (56.37%, 3530\/6262), and identified as white, non-Hispanic (83.17%, 5208\/6262). Abdominal hysterectomy rates decreased from 68.2% (152\/223) to 24.4% (75\/307), and minimally invasive surgeries increased from 31.8% (71\/223) to 75.6% (232\/307) between 2001 or prior years and 2013 (P<.001 all trends). Trends in overall patient satisfaction and recommendations showed significant improvement over time (P<.001).There were differences across the surgical modalities in all patient-reported experiences (ie, satisfaction, time to walking, driving and working, and whether patients would recommend or use the same technique again; P<.001). Significantly better outcomes were evident among women who had vaginal, laparoscopic, and robotic procedures than among those who had an abdominal procedure. However, robotic surgery was the only approach that was an independent predictor of better patient experience; these patients were more satisfied overall (odds ratio [OR] 1.31, 95% CI 1.13-1.51) and on six other satisfaction measures, and more likely to recommend (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.39-1.94) and choose the same modality again (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.67-2.57). Abdominal hysterectomy patients were more dissatisfied with outcomes after surgery and less likely to recommend (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.31-0.40) or choose the same technique again (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.25-0.33). Quicker return to normal activities and surgery after 2007 also were independently associated with better overall satisfaction, willingness to recommend, and to choose the same surgery again. Conclusions Consistent with other US data, laparoscopic and robotic hysterectomy rates increased over time, with a concomitant decline in abdominal hysterectomy. While inherent shortcomings of this retrospective Web-based study exist, findings show that patient experience was better for each of the major minimally invasive approaches than for abdominal hysterectomy. However, robotic-assisted hysterectomy was the only modality that independently predicted greater satisfaction and willingness to recommend and have the same procedure again.","authors":"M.

Purpose We aimed to evaluate the learning curve, if any, of this new technology over the course of our experience. Overview of Literature Percutaneous pedicle screws have specific advantages over open freehand screws. However, they require intraoperative imaging for their placement (e.g., fluoroscopy and navigation) and require increased surgeon training and skill with the learning curve estimated at approximately 20\u201330 cases. To our knowledge, this is the first study that measures the learning curve of robot-guided purely percutaneous pedicle screw placement with comprehensive objective postoperative computed tomography (CT) scoring, time per screw placement, and fluoroscopy time. Methods We included the first 80 consecutive patients undergoing robot-assisted spinal surgery at Melbourne Private Hospital. Data were collected for pedicle screw placement accuracy, placement time, fluoroscopy time, and revision rate. Patient demographic and relevant perioperative and procedural data were also collected. The patients were divided equally into four sub-groups as per their chronological date of surgery to evaluate how the learning curve affected screw placement outcomes. Results Total 80 patients were included; 73 (91%) had complete data and postoperative CT imaging that could help assess that placement of 352 thoracolumbar pedicle screws. The rate of clinically acceptable screw placement was high (96.6%, 95.4%, 95.6%, and 90.7%, in groups 1 to 4, respectively, p=0.314) over time. The median time per screw was 7.0 minutes (6.5, 7.0, 6.0, and 6.0 minutes in groups 1 to 4, respectively, p=0.605). Intraoperative revision occurred in only 1 of the 352 screws (0.3%). Conclusions We found that robot-assisted screw placement had high accuracy, low placement time, low fluoroscopy time, and a low complication rate. However, there were no significant differences in these parameters at the initial experience and the practiced, experience placement (after approximately 1 year), indicating that robot-assisted pedicle screw placement has a very short (almost no) learning curve.","authors":"J.

A recent randomized clinical trial has brought into question the safety of minimally invasive radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer.\n\n\nObjective\nTo quantify the risk of recurrence and death associated with minimally invasive vs open radical hysterectomy for early-stage cervical cancer reported in observational studies optimized to control for confounding.\n\n\nData Sources\nOvid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science (inception to March 26, 2020) performed in an academic medical setting.\n\n\nStudy Selection\nIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, observational studies were abstracted that used survival analyses to compare outcomes after minimally invasive (laparoscopic or robot-assisted) and open radical hysterectomy in patients with early-stage (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics 2009 stage IA1-IIA) cervical cancer. Study quality was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and included studies with scores of at least 7 points that controlled for confounding by tumor size or stage.\n\n\nData Extraction and Synthesis\nThe Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) checklist was used to abstract data independently by multiple observers. Random-effects models were used to pool associations and to analyze the association between surgical approach and oncologic outcomes.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nRisk of recurrence or death and risk of all-cause mortality.\n\n\nResults\nForty-nine studies were identified, of which 15 were included in the meta-analysis. Of 9499 patients who underwent radical hysterectomy, 49% (n\u2009=\u20094684) received minimally invasive surgery; of these, 57% (n\u2009=\u20092675) received robot-assisted laparoscopy. There were 530 recurrences and 451 deaths reported. The pooled hazard of recurrence or death was 71% higher among patients who underwent minimally invasive radical hysterectomy compared with those who underwent open surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 1.71; 95% CI, 1.36-2.15; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and the hazard of death was 56% higher (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.16-2.11; P\u2009=\u2009.004). Heterogeneity of associations was low to moderate. No association was found between the prevalence of robot-assisted surgery and the magnitude of association between minimally invasive radical hysterectomy and hazard of recurrence or death (2.0% increase in the HR for each 10-percentage point increase in prevalence of robot-assisted surgery [95% CI, -3.4% to 7.7%]) or all-cause mortality (3.7% increase in the HR for each 10-percentage point increase in prevalence of robot-assisted surgery [95% CI, -4.5% to 12.6%]).\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies found that among patients undergoing radical hysterectomy for early-stage cervical cancer, minimally invasive radical hysterectomy was associated with an elevated risk of recurrence and death compared with open surgery.","authors":"R.

Commercially available hemostatic agents are commonly used during this surgery to reduce this risk despite a paucity of data supporting the practice. We assessed the impact of fibrin sealant hemostatic agents, a costly addition to surgeries, during robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN).\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nBetween 2007 and 2011, 114 consecutive patients underwent RAPN by a single surgeon (MEA). Evicel fibrin sealant was used in the first 74 patients during renorraphy. The last 40 patients had renorraphy performed without the use of any hemostatic agents. Clinicopathologic, operative, and complication data were compared between groups. Multivariate and univariate logistic regression analysis was performed to test the association between the use of fibrin sealants and operative outcomes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatient demographic data and clinical tumor characteristics were similar between groups. The use of fibrin sealant did not increase operative time (166.3 vs 176.1 minutes, P=0.28), warm ischemia time (WIT) (14.4 vs 16.1 minutes, P=0.18), or length of hospital stay (2.6 vs 2.4 days, P=0.35). The omission of these agents did not increase estimated blood loss (116.6 vs 176.1\u2009mL, P=0.8) or postoperative blood transfusion (0% vs 2.5%, P=0.17). Univariate analysis demonstrated no association between use of fibrin sealants and increased complications (P>0.05). Multivariable logistic regression showed no statistically significant predictive value of omission of hemostatic agents for perioperative outcomes (P>0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPerioperative hemorrhage and other major complications after contemporary RAPN are rare in experienced hands. In our study, the use of fibrin sealants during RAPN does not decrease the rate of complications, blood loss, or hospital stay. Furthermore, no impact is seen on operative time, WIT, or other negative outcomes. Omitting these agents during RAPN could be a safe, effective, cost-saving measure.","authors":"Jason E. Cohen, G.

No studies have been published regarding the cost and outcome of robotic inguinal hernia surgery in a European Union setting. Methods A retrospective comparative study was performed on the early outcome and costs related to laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair, with either conventional or robot-assisted surgery. Results The study analysed 676 patients undergoing laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (272 conventional and 404 robotic repairs). Conventional laparoscopic and robotic repair groups were comparable in terms of duration of surgery (57.6 versus 56.2 min respectively; P\u2009=\u20090.224), intraoperative complication rate (1.1 versus 1.2 per cent; P\u2009=\u20090.990), in-hospital complication rate (4.4 versus 4.5 per cent; P\u2009=\u20090.230) and readmission rate (3.3 versus 1.2 per cent; P\u2009=\u20090.095). There was a significant difference in hospital stay in favour of the robotic approach (P\u2009=\u20090.014), with more patients treated on an outpatient basis in the robotic group (59.2 per cent versus 70.0 per cent for conventional repair). At 4-week follow-up, equal numbers of seromas or haematomas were recorded in the conventional laparoscopic and robotic groups (13.3 versus 15.7 per cent respectively; P\u2009=\u20090.431), but significantly more umbilical wound infections were seen in the conventional group (3.0 per cent versus 0 per cent in the robotic group; P\u2009=\u20090.001). Robotic inguinal hernia repair was significantly more expensive overall, with a mean cost of \u20ac2612 versus \u20ac1963 for the conventional laparoscopic approach (mean difference \u20ac649; P\u2009<\u20090.001).

Detailed information regarding their specific characteristics and prognostic factors is limited.\n\n\nMETHODS\nClinical parameters of BOT patients treated between 1998 and 2008 in 24 German centres were retrospectively investigated. Central pathology review and prospective follow-up were carried out. Patients <40 versus \u226540 years were analysed separately and then compared regarding clinico-pathological variables and prognosis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 950 BOT patients with a median age of 49.1 (14.1-91.5) years were analysed [280 patients <40 years (29.5%), 670 patients \u226540 years (70.5%)]. Fertility-preserving surgery was carried out in 53.2% (149 of 280) of patients <40 years with preservation of the primarily affected ovary in 32 of these 149 cases (21.5%). Recurrence was significantly more frequent in patients <40 years (19.0% versus 10.1% 5-year recurrence rate, P < 0.001), usually in ovarian tissue, whereas disease-specific overall survival did not differ between the subgroups. In case of recurrent disease, malignant transformation was less frequent in younger than in older patients (12.0% versus 66.7%, P < 0.001), mostly presenting as invasive peritoneal carcinomatosis. Multivariate analysis for patients <40 years identified advanced International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage and fertility-sparing approach as independent prognostic factors negatively affecting progression-free survival (PFS) while, for patients \u226540 years, higher FIGO stage and incomplete staging was associated with impaired PFS.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDespite favourable survival, young BOT patients with child-bearing potential are at higher risk for disease recurrence. However, relapses usually remain BOT in the preserved ovaries as opposed to older patients being at higher risk for malignant transformation in peritoneal or distant localisation. Therefore, fertility-sparing approach can be justified for younger patients after thorough consultation.","authors":"F. Trillsch, S. Mahner, L. Woelber, Eik Vettorazzi, A. Reuss, N. Ewald-Riegler, N.

Any clinically significant complications were recorded.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirty-six patients participated in the study. Eight patients had previously been treated for head and neck cancer. Twenty-nine patients (81%) underwent successful robotic resection. Negative margins were obtained in all 29 patients. Twenty-one of 29 patients were safely extubated prior to leaving the operating room. One patient required short-term tracheotomy tube placement. A total of 9 patients were gastrostomy tube dependent (2 preoperatively, 7 postoperatively). Factors associated with successful robotic resection were lower T classification (P = .01) and edentulism (P = .07). Factors associated with gastrostomy tube dependence were advanced age (P = .02), tumor location in the larynx (P < .001), higher T classification (P = .02), and lower preoperative M. D. Anderson Dysphagia Inventory score (P = .04).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRobot-assisted surgery is feasible and safe for the resection of select head and neck tumors. This clinical series demonstrates that robotic surgery can be utilized successfully in patients with T1 to T4 lesions located in the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx with good preservation of swallow function.","authors":"Bridget A Boudreaux, E.

Results from a recent randomized controlled trial demonstrate that minimally invasive surgery is inferior to laparotomy with regards to disease-free and overall survival. Primary Objective To investigate the oncologic safety of robot-assisted surgery for early-stage cervical cancer as compared with standard laparotomy. Study Hypothesis Robot-assisted laparoscopic radical hysterectomy is non-inferior to laparotomy in regards to recurrence-free survival with the advantage of fewer post-operative complications and superior patient-reported outcomes. Trial Design Prospective, multi-institutional, international, open-label randomized clinical trial. Consecutive women with early-stage cervical cancer will be assessed for eligibility and subsequently randomized 1:1 to either robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery or laparotomy. Institutional review board approval will be required from all participating institutions. The trial is coordinated from Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden. Major Inclusion\/Exclusion Criteria Women over 18 with cervical cancer FIGO (2018) stages IB1, IB2, and IIA1 squamous, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous will be included. Women are not eligible if they have evidence of metastatic disease, serious co-morbidity, or a secondary invasive neoplasm in the past 5\u2009years. Primary Endpoint Recurrence-free survival at 5 years between women who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery versus laparotomy for early-stage cervical cancer. Sample Size The clinical non-inferiority margin in this study is defined as a 5-year recurrence-free survival not worsened by >7.5%. With an expected recurrence-free survival of 85%, the study needs to observe 127 events with a one-sided level of significance (\u03b1) of 5% and a power (1\u2212\u03b2) of 80%. With 5 years of recruitment and 3 years of follow-up, the necessary number of events will be reached if the study can recruit a total of 768 patients. Estimated Dates for Completing Accrual and Presenting Results Trial launch is estimated to be May 2019 and the trial is estimated to close in May 2027 with presentation of data shortly thereafter.

Methods All patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of early-stage cervical cancer, FIGO stage IB1, who underwent abdominal radical hysterectomy (ARH), laparoscopic radical hysterectomy, or robotic radical hysterectomy with or without pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy were included in the study. A review of the literature was conducted. Results Three hundred forty-one patients, between January 2001 and December 2016, were included in this study: 101 patients were submitted to ARH, 152 to laparoscopic radical hysterectomy, and 88 to robotic radical hysterectomy. In 97% and 11.5% of cases, bilateral pelvic and aortic lymph node dissections were performed, respectively. The 3 groups were similar in regard to clinical characteristics. Compared with ARH, the minimally invasive surgery group was safer in terms of estimated blood loss, transfusion rates, and hospital stay. Above all, robotic surgery was equivalent to laparoscopy in terms of intraoperative and postoperative complications, hospital stay, conversions, and reintervention. On the other hand, robotic surgery had better outcomes compared with laparoscopy in terms of transfusion rates and was equivalent to abdominal surgery and laparoscopy in regard to oncological outcomes. Conclusions Our study confirmed that minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopy or robotics) was as adequate and effective as abdominal surgery in terms of surgical and oncological outcomes in the surgical treatment of EEC FIGO stage IB1.","authors":"G.

Whilst technologies such as navigation and robotics have demonstrated superior radiological outcomes in many fields of surgery, the impact of augmented reality (AR) assistance in the operating room is still unknown. Malposition of the glenoid component in shoulder arthroplasty is known to result in implant failure and early revision surgery. The use of AR has many promising advantages, including allowing the detailed study of patient-specific anatomy without the need for invasive procedures such as arthroscopy to interrogate the joint\u2019s articular surface. In addition, this technology has the potential to assist surgeons intraoperatively in aiding the guidance of surgical tools. It offers the prospect of increased component placement accuracy, reduced surgical procedure time, and improved radiological and functional outcomes, without recourse to the use of large navigation or robotic instruments, with their associated high overhead costs. This feasibility study describes the surgical workflow from a standardised CT protocol, via 3D reconstruction, 3D planning, and use of a commercial AR headset, to AR-assisted k-wire placement. Post-operative outcome was measured using a high-resolution laser scanner on the patient-specific 3D printed bone. In this proof-of-concept study, the discrepancy between the planned and the achieved glenoid entry point and guide-wire orientation was approximately 3 mm with a mean angulation error of 5\u00b0.","authors":"Klaus Schlueter-Brust, J.

However, laparoscopic colorectal surgery is technically more challenging than conventional surgery. This challenge is more profound for laparoscopic rectal cancer, where there is a need to perform a total mesorectal excision (TME), in the confines of the pelvis, with the limitations of the laparoscopic system. The Da Vinci robotic surgical system was designed to overcome the pitfalls of laparoscopic surgery, hence the use of this novel system in colorectal surgery seems logical, in particular with regards to rectal cancer surgery. Recently, there have been an increasing number of reports in the literature on robotic colorectal surgery. The advantages of the robotic surgical system include; 7 degrees of movement, 3 dimensional views, tremor filtration, motion scaling and superior ergonomics. These advantages when applied to robotic TME for rectal cancer surgery may potentially translate to better outcomes. The aim of this review is to summarise the current evidence on clinical and oncological outcomes of robotic rectal cancer surgery.","authors":"Q. Leong, S. H.

Over the past 20 years, technology has been used in the Operating Room (OR) to help improve precision and balance. The results of Computer-Assisted Surgery (CAS) and robotic systems show improved accuracy regarding implant positioning but a relatively small improvement in patient-reported outcomes and implant survival compared to conventional TKA. Recently, Augmented Reality (AR) has been proposed as a technology that could improve accuracy in orthopaedic surgery, providing a more efficient and cost-effective solution. This article describes a novel AR-based surgical guidance system that measures intra-operatively the effect of prosthesis alignment and positioning on soft tissue balance. The system is integrated in a pair of smart glasses and two small sensors and displays surgical targets directly in the field of view of the surgeon. The system has been used in a limited number of cases. While the preliminary experience has been positive, clinical research is ongoing to confirm to confirm the performance of the system and the impact on clinical outcomes. Augmented Reality can be a valuable tool to improve accuracy in TKA. The use of smart glasses and integrated sensors improves the efficiency of the procedure, particularly when coupled with single-use instrumentation. A novel protocol for soft tissue assessment allows for a 3-dimensional evaluation of the ligaments and a better measurement of the effect of tibial rotation.","authors":"S. Fucentese, P.

Minimal postoperative pain has been reported following robot assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) but there have been few comparative studies with RRP. We compared perioperative narcotic use and patient reported pain in a prospective patient series.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBetween June 2003 and May 2004, 314 patients underwent radical prostatectomy at our institution, including RALP in 159, RRP in 154 and conversion in 1. All patients were treated on a postoperative clinical pathway that included 30 mg ketorolac intravenously immediately postoperatively, followed by 15 mg intravenously every 6 hours. No regional anesthesia (epidural\/spinal) narcotics or patient controlled analgesic pumps were used. All narcotic use was converted to morphine sulfate equivalents for purpose of analysis. A Likert scale of 0 to 10 was used to assess pain on the day of surgery, and on postoperative days 1 and 14.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe total mean morphine sulfate equivalent +\/- SD in patients in the RALP and RRP groups was low and, when corrected for length of stay, it was not statistically different (22.41 +\/- 1.13 vs 23.01 +\/- 1.16 mg, p = 0.72). Mean Likert pain perception scores were low at all time points in the RALP and RRP groups but statistically lower on the day of surgery in the RALP cohort (2.05 +\/- 1.99 vs 2.60 +\/- 2.25, p = 0.027). Patient reported mean pain scores were almost identical for RALP vs RRP on postoperative days 1 (1.76 +\/- 1.87 vs 1.73 +\/- 1.77, p = 0.880) and 14 (2.51 +\/- 1.91 vs 2.42 +\/- 1.84, p = 0.722).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPerioperative narcotic use and patient reported pain are low regardless of the surgical approach used for radical prostatectomy. RALP did not provide a clinically meaningful decrease in pain compared with RRP, primarily because of the low pain scores reported in each group. Outcomes other than pain will ultimately determine the role of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and RALP.","authors":"Todd M. Webster, S. Herrell, Sam S. Chang, Michael Cookson, R.

However, operating in a highly dynamic in-vivo environment is complex. Supervisory control functions should be included to ensure flexibility and safety during the autonomous control phase. This paper presents a haptic rendering interface to enable supervised semi-autonomous control for a surgical robot. Bayesian optimization is used to tune user-specific parameters during the surgical training process. User studies were conducted on a customized simulator for validation. Detailed comparisons are made between with and without the supervised semi-autonomous control mode in terms of the number of clutching events, task completion time, master robot end-effector trajectory and average control speed of the slave robot. The effectiveness of the Bayesian optimization is also evaluated, demonstrating that the optimized parameters can significantly improve users\u2019 performance. Results indicate that the proposed control method can reduce the operator\u2019s workload and enhance operation efficiency.","authors":"Junhong Chen, Dandan Zhang, A. Munawar, Ruiqi Zhu, Benny P. L.

More recently, the technique has been modified from a multiport video-assisted thoracic surgery (mVATS) to uniportal (uVATS) and robotic (rVATS), with proponents for each approach. Additionally most lobectomies are still performed using an open approach. We sought to provide evidence-based recommendations to help define the optimal surgical approach to lobectomy for early stage non-small cell lung cancer. Methods Systematic review and meta-analysis of articles searched without limits from January 2000 to January 2018 comparing open, mVATS, uVATS, and rVATS using sources Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library were considered for inclusion. Articles were individually scrutinized by ISMICS consensus conference members, and evidence-based statements were created and consensus processes were used to determine the ensuing recommendations. The ACC\/AHA Clinical Practice Guideline Recommendation Classification system was used to assess the overall quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations. Results and recommendations One hundred and forty-five studies met the predefined inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Comparisons were analyzed between VATS and open, and between different VATS approaches looking at oncological outcomes (survival, recurrence, lymph node evaluation), safety (adverse events), function (pain, quality of life, pulmonary function), and cost-effectiveness. Fifteen statements addressing these areas achieved consensus. The highest level of evidence suggested that mVATS is preferable to open lobectomy with lower adverse events (36% versus 42%; 88,460 patients) and less pain (IIa recommendation). Our meta-analysis suggested that overall survival was better (IIb) with mVATS compared with open (71.5% versus 66.7% 5-years; 16,200 patients). Different VATS approaches were similar for most outcomes, although uVATS may be associated with less pain and analgesic requirements (IIb). Conclusions This meta-analysis supports the role of VATS lobectomy for non-small cell lung cancer. Apart from potentially less pain and analgesic requirement with uVATS, different minimally invasive surgical approaches appear to have similar outcomes.","authors":"C. Ng, J. Macdonald, S.

During this time interval, the data showed a 30% increase in use of what is termed laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) and a 12% decrease in standard open technique, most likely due to the introduction of robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Although RARP is different from LRP, the authors are unable to separate LRP from RARP. Patient interest in RARP has been the result of a highly successful marketing campaign with resultant consumer demand. Patients have been led to believe that hospital and recovery times are shorter and outcomes are better, but study has shown this expectation not to be the case. RARP is simply an alternative method to extract the prostate. In this study, patients undergoing LRP were found to have shorter lengths of stay (mean, 1.42 days v 4.35 days; P .001), but were more likely to require salvage therapy (27.8% v 9.1%; P .001) with radiation therapy plus androgen deprivation therapy for local relapse. Patients who underwent LRP\/RARP appeared to have more anastomotic strictures than open surgery (15.2% v 12%; P .11). However, the authors did note that high-volume LRP\/RARP surgeons were able to reduce these complication rates and the likelihood of local relapse, though both were still more frequent after LRP\/RARP than after open technique. Obviously, in any analysis of the Medicare-age population, beneficiary claims data represent a 35,000-ft view of the practice since Medicare claims data cannot reliably be a surrogate for surgical outcome data. However, we believe the trends are more than likely true. The decrement in oncologic outcome (requiring more salvage therapy for local relapse) and increased incidence of anastomotic stricture may be related to do the steep initial learning curve for both LRP\/RARP, though more analysis of detailed data would be required to determine this with certainty. Certainly, almost 30% of patients in the LRP\/RARP group requiring salvage therapy compared with 9% in the open technique would imply greater oncologic efficacy in the latter. However, without multivariate analysis including clinical and pathologic data, one cannot reliably account for these differences. It is disconcerting that the anastomotic stricture rate is higher than, and not superior to, open technique. Good technique prevents strictures. Anastomotic stricture results in a significant decrease in urinary quality of life including difficult bladder emptying, recurrent urinary tract infection, and bleeding. Necessary repeated corrective procedures may result in progressive incontinence. One of the major touted features of both LRP\/RARP is improved anastomosis based on wristing (a technical term relating to the robot\u2019s ability for greater than 360 degrees rotation for suturing) and magnification. Once again, this may speak to the volume issue; that is, an inadequate period of training with too rapid adoption of LRP\/RARP and high initial complication rates. It is particularly noteworthy that men undergoing LRP\/RARP appeared to have fewer perioperative complications than open prostatectomy, while at the same time the patients were statistically significantly older with more comorbid conditions. The data in this study indicate that the complication rates to open surgery may not be consistent with that reported for optimal open surgery. The reported rates of cardiac (6.6%), respiratory (11.7%), vascular (6.5%), wound\/ bleeding (3.6%), and genitourinary complications (8.0%) are not what are being achieved by most high-volume, open radical prostatectomy surgeons in this country. Cardiovascular perioperative complications should be 1% or less in centers at which a high volume of open radical prostatectomy is performed. Certainly, the length of stay experienced by patients who undergo open radical prostatectomy by most high-volume surgeons is consistently less than 48 hours and not over 4 days as reported in this analysis. Similarly, anastomotic stricture rates are more likely in the 2% to 4% range after open techniques rather than the 12% reported herein. Men treated by either LRP\/ RARP or open radical prostatectomy can follow the same care pathway, so length of stay should not be an issue. The data strongly suggest that documentation of the surgical expertise of the surgeons performing both open and LRP\/RARP surgery should be required by specialty societies and training programs as a prerequisite for board certification. Open surgery has its own learning curve. Importantly, as an obvious downside, LRP\/RARP provides minimal or limited access to the prostate without helpful assistance of direct manipulation or tactile feedback. When LRP\/ RARP surgeons are in trouble, they may need to convert emergently to an open procedure to control life-threatening bleeding. To be unfamiliar with, incompetent, or inexperienced in open surgery would constitute a grievous error in training. We note that the authors did not perform an analysis of the prostatectomy volume by surgeon in terms of complication rates in the open series, and this would be noteworthy. Would not the same improvement in complication trend be expected for high-volume open surgeons?

Recent findings HNSCC represents one of the cancer locations where the primary treatment modality is the most under discussion. Indeed, the respective roles of primary surgical resection followed, as necessary, by adjuvant radiotherapy or definitive chemoradiotherapy remain controversial. The results of organ preservation trials and the drastic rise in the incidence of human papillomavirus-induced oropharyngeal tumors, which are known to be highly radiosensitive, have led to an increasing use of chemoradiation-based therapies in HNSCC patients. However, no chemoradiation-based protocol has shown better oncologic outcomes than radical primary surgery. Moreover, development of minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as transoral robotic surgery, and advances in head and neck microvascular reconstruction have considerably improved the clinical outcomes of the patients and have led to a reconsideration of the role of primary surgery in HNSCC patients. Summary Surgery should be the primary treatment modality for most resectable oral cavity cancers and for T4a laryngeal\/hypopharyngeal cancers. Primary surgery could also be the preferred modality of treatment for most early (T1\u2013T2, N0) laryngeal and hypo\/oropharyngeal carcinomas when this strategy offers an opportunity to reserve radiotherapy for a potential recurrence or second primary tumor. Primary surgery should also be considered in patients with locally advanced human papillomavirus-negative oropharyngeal carcinoma.","authors":"A. Bozec, D. Culi\u00e9, G. Poissonnet, O.

Minimally invasive pancreatic resections (MIPRs) have become a part of standard surgical practice worldwide over the last decade; however, in comparison with other surgical procedures, the implementation of minimally invasive approaches into clinical practice has been rather slow. The aim of this study was to highlight and summarize the available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the role of minimally invasive approaches in pancreatic surgery. A WHO trial registry and Pubmed database literature search was performed to identify all RCTs comparing MIPRs (robot-assisted and\/or laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy [DP] or pancreatoduodenectomy [PD]) with open pancreatic resections (OPRs). Overall, five RCTs on MIPR versus OPR have been published and seven RCTs are currently recruiting. For DP, the results of two RCTs were in favor of minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy (MIDP) in terms of shorter hospital stay and less intraoperative blood loss, with comparable morbidity and mortality. Regarding PD, two RCTs showed similar advantages for MIPD. However, concerns were raised after the early termination of the third multicenter RCT on MIPD versus open PD due to higher complication-related mortality in the laparoscopic group and no clear other demonstrable advantages. No RCTs on robot-assisted pancreatic procedures are available as yet. At the current level of evidence, MIDP is thought to be safe and feasible, although oncological safety should be further evaluated. Based on the results of the RCTs conducted for PD, MIPD cannot be proclaimed as the superior alternative to open PD, although promising outcomes have been demonstrated by experienced centers. Future studies should provide answers to the role of robotic approaches in pancreatic surgery and aim to identity the subgroups of patients or indications with the greatest benefit of MIPRs.","authors":"J. van Hilst, N. de Graaf, M.

Several surgical specialties have subsequently integrated robotic surgery into common clinical practice. Plastic and reconstructive microsurgical procedures have not yet benefitted significantly from technical developments observed over the last two decades. Several studies have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of utilising surgical robots in plastic surgery procedures, yet limited work has been done to identify and analyse current barriers that have prevented wide-scale adaptation of surgical robots for microsurgery. Therefore, a systematic review using PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science databases was performed, in order to evaluate current state of surgical robotics within the field of reconstructive microsurgery and their limitations. Despite the theoretical potential of surgical robots, current commercially available robotic systems are suboptimal for plastic or reconstructive microsurgery. Absence of bespoke microsurgical instruments, increases in operating time, and high costs associated with robotic-assisted provide a barrier to using such systems effectively for reconstructive microsurgery. Consequently, surgical robots provide currently little overall advantage over conventional microsurgery.

Currently, over 50% of radical prostatectomies (RPs) in the United States are done robotically. The article by Dr. Chin and colleagues1 provides a perspective on this trend. Robotic technology represents a challenge to our Canadian system, yet it has rapidly spread throughout the US (where there are over 350 robots). \n \nWith the da Vinci, the advantages of magnification and binocular vision, 6 or more degrees of freedom, and reduced fatigue (surgeons sit during the procedure) are apparent. Demonstrating an improved outcome should only be a matter of time, one would think. \n \nYet, compared with open surgery, the data so far show no clear evidence of improved oncologic outcome or side effect profile, despite the decreased blood loss and reduced transfusion requirements of robotic surgery (compared with open surgery, not conventional laparoscopic surgery). However, the duration of hospital stay, analgesic requirements, time off work and recovery seem relatively similar. The robotic approach, however, needs more advantages to justify the cost. Improved outcome may be difficult to demonstrate. Variation in outcome with respect to PSA recurrence, potency sparing and incontinence varies a great deal, even among high-volume surgeons. These variations seem to be more dependent on the surgeons, as opposed to the different techniques of accessing the prostate.2 \n \nThe experience reported by Chin and colleagues supports this observation. The results are acceptable, but not stellar: a positive margin rate of 30%, 10% of patients with moderate and 20% with mild stress incontinence, an average hospital stay of 3.5 days and an average of 12 days with an indwelling catheter. These results will likely improve over time, but the results of an experienced surgeon doing open radical prostatectomy are a high bar. Another difficult issue in the rush toward robotic prostatectomy is the volume-quality outcome relation. The outcome is best when the surgeon's annual volume is 50 cases or more. Given the cost of the da Vinci and the length of the learning curve,3 it makes sense that robotic prostatectomy would be performed in high volumes by a few surgeons at centres of excellence. \n \nIn attempting to maintain market share, every hospital in the US, large or small, is motivated to acquire the device. Nonetheless, 90% of US urologists who do RP perform fewer than 10 annually. Additionally, once these units are acquired, they take on their own mandate: \u201cUse Me,\u201d resulting in the unseemly marketing of robotic prostatectomy as a minimally invasive procedure with no morbidity. Horsefeathers. Minimal access does not mean minimally invasive, and the morbidity reported to date is comparable to the open approach. \n \nOne hopes that in Canada we will demonstrate some maturity in our approach to this expensive device. A few robots (perhaps 5\u201310) should be purchased by acknowledged centres of excellence across the country, where a limited number of surgeons would maintain a high volume of cases and quickly develop expertise.

It has been shown that the minimally invasive robotic approach offers comparable oncologic and functional outcomes with potential advantages, including decreased blood loss, shorter hospital stay, and recovery period when compared with open surgery. Generally, the transperitoneal RARP approach is the most commonly performed among robotic surgeons, owing to its wider space and early adoption. However, similar oncologic outcomes have been reported with the extraperitoneal approach. Owing to its perceived technical difficulty, extraperitoneal RARP is less adopted nowadays. This approach, however, has its merits particularly in cases where intraperitoneal access can be problematic with extensive adhesions from previous surgeries. Also, extraperitoneal approach allows for minimal bowel manipulation, less steep Trendelenburg positioning, and less pneumoperitoneum, which reflect on early recovery of bowel function after RARP. Both transperitoneal and extraperitoneal approaches can be performed using either the conventional multiport robotic system or the more recent single-port (SP) robotic system. With respect to extraperitoneal RARP, there has been an increased adoption of the SP system, with purported advantages such as better cosmesis, less postoperative analgesic and opioid requirements, and shorter duration of hospital stay. Herein, we describe the technical steps relevant to extraperitoneal single-port robot-assisted radical prostatectomy, and elaborate on the clinical outcomes reported in the literature.","authors":"M.

Although small degrees of incidental incontinence may go virtually unnoticed, larger degrees of incontinence can have a major impact on a man's quality of life.Conceptually, post-prostatectomy incontinence may be caused by sphincter malfunction or bladder dysfunction, or both. Most men with post-prostatectomy incontinence (60% to 100%) have stress urinary incontinence, which is involuntary urinary leakage on effort or exertion, or on sneezing or coughing. This may be due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency and may be treated with surgery for optimal management of incontinence. Detrusor dysfunction is more common after surgery for benign prostatic disease.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo determine the effects of surgical treatment for urinary incontinence related to presumed sphincter deficiency after prostate surgery for:- men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) - transurethral resection of prostate (TURP), photo vaporisation of the prostate, laser enucleation of the prostate or open prostatectomy - and- men with prostate cancer - radical prostatectomy (retropubic, perineal, laparoscopic, or robotic).\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE in process, ClinicalTrials.gov, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 31 March 2014); MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2014); EMBASE (January 1988 to April 2014); and LILACS (January 1982 to April 2014). We handsearched the reference lists of relevant articles and conference proceedings. We contacted investigators to locate studies.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised or quasi-randomised trials that include surgical treatments of urinary incontinence after prostate surgery.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo authors independently screened the trials identified, appraised quality of papers, and extracted data.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nOnly one study with 45 participants met the inclusion criteria. Men were divided in two sub-groups (minimal or total incontinence) and each group was randomised to artificial urethral sphincter (AUS) implantation or Macroplastique injection. Follow-up ranged from six to 120 months. In the trial as a whole, the men treated with AUS were more likely to be dry (18\/20, 82%) than those who had the injectable treatment (11\/23, 46%) (odds ratio (OR) 5.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 25.10). However, this effect was only statistically significant for the men with more severe ('total') incontinence (OR 8.89, 95% CI 1.40 to 56.57) and the CIs were wide. There were more severe complications in the group undergoing AUS, and the costs were higher. AUS implantation was complicated in 5\/22 (23%) men: the implant had to be removed from one man because of infection and in one man due to the erosion of the cuff, in one man the pump was changed due to mechanical failure, in one man there was migration to the intraperitoneal region, and one man experienced scrotal erosion. In the injectable group, 3\/23 (13%) men had a complication: one man treated with Macroplastique injection had to be catheterised because of urinary retention and two men developed urinary tract infections.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThe evidence available at present was of very low quality because we identified only one small randomised clinical trial. Although the result was favourable for the implantation of AUS in the group with severe incontinence, this result should be considered with caution due to the small sample size and uncertain methodological quality of the study found.","authors":"L.

Robot-assisted kidney transplantation (RAKT) is gradually becoming preferred technique in adults, even if applied in very few centra, with potentially improved clinical outcomes compared with open kidney transplantation. To date, only very few RAKT procedures in children have been described. Kidney transplant recipient patients, being immunocompromised, might be at increased risk for perioperative surgical complications, which creates additional challenges in management. Applying techniques of minimally invasive surgery may contribute to the improvement of clinical outcomes for the pediatric transplant patients population and help mitigate the morbidity of KT. However, many challenges remain ahead. Minimally invasive surgery has been consistently shown to produce improved clinical outcomes as compared to open surgery equivalents. Robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery (RALS) has been able to overcome many restrictions of classical laparoscopy, particularly in complex and demanding surgical procedures. Despite the presence of these improvements, many challenges lie ahead in the surgical and technical\u2013material realms, in addition to anesthetic and economic considerations. RALS in children poses additional challenges to both the surgical and anesthesiology team, due to specific characteristics such as a small abdominal cavity and a reduced circulating blood volume. Cost-effectiveness, esthetic and functional wound outcomes, minimal age and weight to undergo RALS and effect of RAKT on graft function are discussed. Although data on RAKT in children is scarce, it is a safe and feasible procedure and results in excellent graft function. It should only be performed by a RAKT team experienced in both RALS and transplantation surgery, fully supported by a pediatric nephrology and anesthesiology team. Further research is necessary to better determine the value of the robotic approach as compared to the laparoscopic and open approach. Cost-effectiveness will remain an important subject of debate and is in need of further evaluation as well.","authors":"Julien Grammens, M. Y. Schechter, L. Desender, T. Claeys, C. Sinatti, J.

Assessment of perioperative outcomes, positive surgical margins, and use of additional cancer treatments.","abstract":"INTRODUCTION\nDespite a rapid dissemination of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) over open radical prostatectomy (ORP), to date no study has compared perioperative outcomes between the two approaches in patients with high-risk prostate cancer (PCa). The aim of our study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of RARP in this setting.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nOverall, 1,512 patients with high-risk PCa within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End RESULTS (SEER) Medicare-linked database diagnosed between 2008 and 2009 were abstracted. Patients were treated with RARP or ORP. Postoperative complications, blood transfusions, prolonged length of stay (pLOS), positive surgical margins, and additional cancer therapy rates were compared. Propensity-score matched analyses and logistic regression models fitted with generalized estimating equations for clustering among hospitals were performed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall, 706 (46.7%) and 806 (53.3%) patients underwent ORP and RARP, respectively. Following propensity-matched analyses, 706 patients remained. No differences were observed in complications (P=0.6), positive surgical margins (P=0.4), or additional therapy after surgery (P=0.2) between patients treated with RARP and ORP; however, RARP was associated with lower rates of transfusions and shorter hospitalization (all P<0.001). In multivariable analyses, patients undergoing RARP were less likely to receive a blood transfusion (P=0.002) or to experience pLOS (P<0.001) compared with men treated with ORP.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRARP and ORP have comparable complications, positive surgical margins, and additional cancer therapy rates in high-risk PCa. RARP is associated with lower rates of blood transfusions and shorter hospital stays. These findings suggest that RARP is safe and feasible even in this clinical scenario.","authors":"G.

Few studies have analysed the disparity in costs and clinical outcomes between techniques. Since donors are healthy patients expecting minimum pain and fast recovery, this study aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of four nephrectomy techniques focusing on early surgical outcomes, an essential in the donation act.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA micro-costing approach was used to estimate the cost of implementation from a hospital perspective. Estimates took into account sterilization costs for multiple-use equipment, costs for purchasing single-use equipment, staff and analgesics. The study recruited donors in 20 centres in France. Quality of life by EuroQol-5D was assessed preoperatively, and 4 and 90\u2009days post-operatively. Two effectiveness indicators were built: quality-of-life recovery and post-operative pain days averted (PPDA). The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02830568, on 10 June 2010.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 264 donors were included; they underwent open surgery (n\u2009=\u200965), and standard (n\u2009=\u200965), hand-assisted (n\u2009=\u200965) and robot-assisted laparoscopies (n\u2009=\u200969). Use of the nephrectomy techniques differed greatly in cost of implementation and immediate post-operative outcomes but not in clinical outcomes at 90\u2009days. At 4\u2009days, hand-assisted laparoscopy provided the lowest cost per quality-of-life recovery unit of effectiveness (%) and PPDA (days) (\u20ac2056\/40.1%\/2.3\u2009days, respectively). Robot-assisted laparoscopy was associated with the best post-operative outcomes but with the highest cost (\u20ac3430\/59.1%\/2.6\u2009days).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nHand-assisted, standard and robot-assisted laparoscopies are cost-effective techniques compared with open surgery. Hand-assisted surgery is the most cost-effective procedure. Robot-assisted surgery requires more healthcare resource use but enables the best clinical outcome.","authors":"H. Achit, F. Guillemin, G.

RECENT FINDINGS: Minimally invasive surgery has become a standard of care for the treatment of many benign and malignant gynaecological conditions. Recent advances in conventional laparoscopy and robotic-assisted surgery have favorably impacted the entire spectrum of gynaecological surgery. With the goal of improving morbidity and cosmesis, continued efforts towards refinement of laparoscopic techniques have lead to minimization of size and number of ports required for these procedures. LESS surgery is a recently proposed surgical term used to describe various techniques that aim at performing laparoscopic surgery through a single, small-skin incision concealed within the umbilicus. In the last 5 years, there has been a surge in the developments in surgical technology and techniques for LESS surgery, which have resulted in a significant increase in utilisation of LESS across many surgical subspecialties. Recently published outcomes data demonstrate feasibility, safety and reproducibility for LESS in gynaecology. The contemporary LESS literature, extent of gynaecological procedures utilising these techniques and limitations of current technology will be reviewed in this manuscript. CONCLUSIONS: LESS surgery represents the newest frontier in minimally invasive surgery. Comparative data and prospective trials are necessary in order to determine the clinical impact of LESS in treatment of gynaecological conditions.","authors":"A. Fader, K. Levinson, C.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of robotic milling on the accuracy of short femoral stem positioning and on the short-term clinical outcome in THA using a prospective, randomized design. Methods: We randomized 54 patients into two groups, either robotic milling group or manual rasping group. The patients were assessed clinically and radiographically at 8 weeks, 5 months, 12 months, and 24 months. Results: Robotic milling group had a significantly longer operation time, requiring on average 8.9\u2009min for registration and 11.2\u2009min for milling. On the other hand, robotic milling group showed superior results in terms of stem alignment and leg length equality. Two intraoperative femoral fractures occurred only in manual rasping group. Harris hip scores and WOMAC scores at 24 months postoperatively were similar in both groups. No complications including stem loosening, infection, nerve palsy, or dislocation were encountered in either group during the follow-up period. Conclusions: The present study suggested that robot-assisted short stem THA could increase the accuracy of stem alignment, improve leg length equality, and help reduce the risk of intraoperative femoral fracture as compared with manual rasping. However, the clinical outcome scores did not differ between the two groups at the time of short-term follow-up.

Matthew R. Cooperberg, Anobel Y. Odisho, and Peter R. Carroll, University of California, San Francisco Helen Diller Comprehensive Cancer Center, San Francisco, CA See accompanying article on page 513 Radical prostatectomy is one of the many treatment options available to men with clinically localized prostate cancer, and it may be the preferred option for some on the basis of cancer risk and patient age, comorbidity, and preferences. 1 The procedure is associated with excellent cancer control rates. Overall prostate cancer\u2013specific sur- vival at 15 years after prostatectomy has been shown to be approxi- mately 93%; even for those with advanced stage (T3, N\u2af9) and\/or high-grade disease (Gleason grade 8-10), that figure is 63% to 74%. 2 Radical prostatectomy is the most highly used treatment for prostate cancer, with approximately 40% to 50% of men selecting this treat- ment initially. 3 The procedure can be performed by using various approaches, including retropubic, perineal and laparoscopic ap- proaches. Laparoscopic prostatectomy can be facilitated by using ro- bot assistance. Until recently, the vast majority of prostatectomies were performed using the open, retropubic approach, whereas the past decade has witnessed a rapid uptake of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) nationwide. The robot is impressive technology, allowing the surgeon to sit at a console and direct a camera and two or three laparoscopic arms with six degrees of wristed motion for cutting, retracting, cauterizing, or suturing\u2014all with high magnification and three-dimensional visual- ization. However, technology that is rapidly adopted should have clear benefits\u2014increased effectiveness, less morbidity, more accessibility, and\/or decreased cost. Many argue that the increased use of robotic technology may not be primarily driven by such benefits but rather by heavy marketing, whether by the company that produces the technol- ogy, by hospitals that have acquired it (at high cost), or by physicians who promote it to gain market share. Hospitals that acquire a robot appear to have the largest increases in surgical volume. 4,5 Indeed, a review of hospital Web sites demonstrates a mix of manufacturer and hospital claims of superior outcomes for robot-assisted surgery, with- out disclaimers regarding the limitations of existing outcomes data. 6 The problem of potentially misleading marketing is by no means unique to robot-assisted surgery; similar marginally founded claims are frequently made about other treatments as well. Although the number of prostatectomies performed has in- creased, the location and costs of installed robotic systems has central- ized care. Whereas outcomes may be improved, centralization leads to decreased access resulting from longer travel times, which dispropor- tionately affect patients with limited financial means. 7 RARP also tends to be more costly; on average, robotic surgery adds approx- \u00a9 2012 by American Society of Clinical Oncology imately $2,200 (20%) to the cost of a prostatectomy as a result of increased supply costs and operating room time. 8,9 To be fair, though, these costs should also be compared with those of other treatment alternatives, such as intensity modulated radiation (IMRT) or proton-beam therapy, whose costs\u2014 both capital and marginal\u2014are far greater. 10 If more efficient care, increased access, and lower costs are not driving the greater use of robotic surgery, then what is? There is no question that RARP is associated with less blood loss, lower transfu- sion rates, and slightly faster convalescence. 11,12 It appears to be essen- tially equivalent to open surgery in terms of cancer control rates. 13,14 The critical question, however, is whether RARP compares favorably with open surgery in terms of patient-centered health-related quality-of-life outcomes. In the article that accompanies this edi- torial, Barry et al 15 are the latest to suggest that it may not. Using a population of patients drawn from a 20% Medicare sample, the authors assessed urinary and sexual bother after open prostatec- tomy and RARP, reporting a nonsignificant trend toward greater urinary bother and equivalent sexual bother after RARP compared with open prostatectomy. Although methodologically much more sound than an earlier analysis that tried to determine health-related quality-of-life outcomes on the basis of claims data alone, 16 the study by Barry et al 15 still has significant limitations, many of which are acknowledged by the au- thors. Given the use of a Medicare data set, all patients were 65 years of age or older. All operations were performed in 2008, when many surgeons may have been climbing the RARP learning curve. There was no baseline functional assessment, and as the authors note, the two groups may not been comparable in that respect. Results are further clouded by the authors\u2019 use of a brief, dichotomized instrument that assessed only bother rather than both function and bother using a standardized, validated instrument such as the Prostate Cancer Index (PCI) 17 or the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC). 18 Patient perception of bother is clearly a key outcome of interest and may associate best with use for health outcome states. However, bother does not correlate perfectly with functional outcomes 19 and may also reflect baseline function and pretreatment expectations. Whether resulting from misleading advertising or counseling or sim- ply from misplaced faith in technology, men opting for RARP tend to have higher expectations than those undergoing open surgery and Journal of Clinical Oncology, Vol 30, No 5 (February 10), 2012: pp 476-478 Information downloaded from jco.ascopubs.org and provided by at CONS CALIFORNIA DIG LIB on July 20, 2016 from Copyright \u00a9 2012 American Society of Clinical Oncology.

The purpose of this study was to assess SEEG safety in the pediatric setting, focusing on surgical complications and the identification of patient and surgical risk factors, if any. The authors also aimed to determine whether robot assistance in SEEG was associated with a change in practice, surgical parameters, and clinical outcomes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe authors retrospectively studied all SEEG cases performed in their department from December 2014 to March 2020. They analyzed both demographic and surgical variables and noted the types of surgery-related complications and their management. They also studied the clinical outcomes of a subset of the patients in relation to robot-assisted and non-robot-assisted SEEG.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSixty-three children had undergone 64 SEEG procedures. Girls were on average 3 years younger than the boys (mean age 11.1 vs 14.1 years, p < 0.01). The overall complication rate was 6.3%, and the complication rate for patients with left-sided electrodes was higher than that for patients with right-sided electrodes (11.1% vs 3.3%), although the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. The duration of recording was positively correlated to the number of implanted electrodes (r = 0.296, p < 0.05). Robot assistance was associated with a higher number of implanted electrodes (mean 12.6 vs 7.6 electrodes, p < 0.0001). Robot-assisted implantations were more accurate, with a mean error of 1.51 mm at the target compared to 2.98 mm in nonrobot implantations (p < 0.001). Clinical outcomes were assessed in the first 32 patients treated (16 in the nonrobot group and 16 in the robot group), 23 of whom proceeded to further resective surgery. The children who had undergone robot-assisted SEEG had better eventual seizure control following subsequent epilepsy surgery. Of the children who had undergone resective epilepsy surgery, 42% (5\/12) in the nonrobot group and 82% (9\/11) in the robot group obtained an Engel class IA outcome at 1 year (\u03c72 = 3.885, p = 0.049). Based on Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the robot group had a higher seizure-free rate than the nonrobot group at 30 months postoperation (7\/11 vs 2\/12, p = 0.063). Two complications, whose causes were attributed to the implantation and head-bandaging steps, required surgical intervention. All complications were either transient or reversible.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis is the largest single-center, exclusively pediatric SEEG series that includes robot assistance so far. SEEG complications are uncommon and usually transient or treatable. Robot assistance enabled implantation of more electrodes and improved epilepsy surgery outcomes, as compared to those in the non-robot-assisted cases.","authors":"Ioannis N. Mavridis, W. Lo, W.

All of the Acrobot group had tibiofemoral alignment in the coronal plane within 2 degrees of the planned position, while only 40% of the conventional group achieved this level of accuracy. While the operations took longer, no adverse effects were noted, and there was a trend towards improvement in performance with increasing accuracy based on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and American Knee Society scores at six weeks and three months. The Acrobot device allows the surgeon to reproduce a pre-operative plan more reliably than is possible using conventional techniques which may have clinical advantages.","authors":"J. Cobb, J.

Forty-nine patients in the R-LAR and 105 in the O-LAR group were matched for age, gender, BMI (body mass index), ASA (American Society of Anesthesiology) class, tumor\u2013node\u2013metastasis (TNM) classification and UICC (Union for International Cancer Control) stage, distance of the lower edge of the tumor from the anal verge, presence of comorbidities, and preoperative hemoglobin (Hb). EBL was significantly higher in the O-LAR group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001); twelve units of packed red blood cells were globally transfused in the O-LAR group, compared to one unit only in the R-LAR (P\u00a0=\u00a00.051). A significantly higher postoperative Hb drop (3.0 vs. 2.4\u00a0g\/dL, P\u00a0=\u00a00.015) was registered in the O-LAR patients. The length of hospital stay was much lower for the R-LAR group (8.4 vs. 12.4\u00a0days, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The number of harvested lymph nodes (17.4 vs. 13.5, P\u00a0=\u00a00.006) and extent of distal margin (2.9 vs. 1.9\u00a0cm, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were significantly higher in the R-LAR group. Open surgery was confirmed as the sole variable significantly associated (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) with blood loss (odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a04.41, 95% CI 2.06\u20139.43).

Frameless image guidance systems that use scalp fiducial markers offer more flexibility and patient comfort but provide less stability and accuracy during drilling and biopsy needle positioning. Head-mounted robot-guided biopsies could provide the advantages of these 2 techniques without the downsides. The goal of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of a robotic guidance device, affixed to the patient's skull through a small mounting platform, for use in brain biopsy procedures.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was a retrospective study of 37 consecutive patients who presented with supratentorial lesions and underwent brain biopsy procedures in which a surgical guidance robot was used to determine clinical outcomes and technical procedural operability.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe portable head-mounted device was well tolerated by the patients and enabled stable drilling and needle positioning during surgery. Flexible adjustments of predefined paths and selection of new trajectories were successfully performed intraoperatively without the need for manual settings and fixations. The patients experienced no permanent deficits or infections after surgery.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe head-mounted robot-guided approach presented here combines the stability of a bone-mounted set-up with the flexibility and tolerability of frameless systems. By reducing human interference (i.e., manual parameter settings, calibrations, and adjustments), this technology might be particularly useful in neurosurgical interventions that necessitate multiple trajectories.","authors":"F.

A novel risk stratification for erectile function recovery after retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) has been proposed recently by Briganti et al. from the University Vita-Salute San Raffaele in Milan, Italy.\n\n\nAIM\nTo evaluate the potency rate in a series of consecutive patients who underwent bilateral nerve-sparing RALP, to identify the preoperative predictors of erectile function recovery, and to validate the risk-group stratification of Briganti et al.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe clinical records of all patients who underwent RALP for clinically localized prostate cancer between April 2005 and April 2009 were prospectively collected in the Prostate Cancer Padua Database. For the present study, we extracted all consecutive cases receiving a bilateral nerve-sparing technique with a minimum follow-up > or =12 months.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nTwelve-month potency rate after RALP, defined as an International Index of Erectile Function 6 (IIEF-6) score > or =18.\n\n\nRESULTS\nData showed that 129 out of 208 enrolled patients (62%) were potent 12 months after surgery. Age (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.8; P < 0.001), Charlson score (HR: 2.9; P = 0.007), and baseline IIEF-6 score (HR: 0.8; P < 0.001) were independent predictors of potency recovery at multivariate analysis. According to Briganti et al.'s risk-group stratification, the 12-month potency rate following RALP was 81.9% in the low-risk group, 56.7% in the intermediate-risk group, and 28.6% in the high-risk group (P < 0.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the era of robotic surgery, the key point for the success of the nerve-sparing technique remains the accurate selection of patients. Age < or =65 years, absence of associated comorbidities, and good preoperative erectile function are the most important preoperative factors to select those patients for whom bilateral nerve-sparing RALP can achieve the best results.","authors":"G.

We collected the following: Patient age, clinical presentation, perioperative data, complications, length of hospital stay, and outcome. Preoperative evaluation of UPJO always included an injected renal CT scan and furosemide-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG-3) renal scintigraphy. Patients were seen at 3 and 6 months after surgery and once a year thereafter. Postoperative success was defined as symptomatic response and radiographic evidence of no further obstruction.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty patients with a mean age of 36.8 +\/- 16 years (range 15-69 yr) were included. Six (30%) patients had previously undergone endoscopic treatment. The mean operative time was 150.3 +\/- 36.22 minutes (range 150-240 min). The mean follow-up was 19.9 +\/- 10.03 months (range 3-37 mos). Two (10%) procedures necessitated conversion to laparoscopic procedures, and there was no conversion to laparotomy. Four (20%) patients experienced minor complications: Two urinary tract infections and two urinomas. Repeated early surgery was needed in one patient for temporary (ie, 8 days) stent placement in the case of urinoma. There was no recurrence of the UPJO, and no repeated surgery was deemed necessary during the follow-up period. The success rate was estimated to be 95%.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFunctional outcomes after robot-assisted procedures for alleviation of UPJO are very promising.

Conventional and Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy were performed in 1,150 and 713 cases, respectively. To compare the continence outcome between groups, propensity score matching was performed using 9 preoperative variables, including age, body mass index, prostate-specific antigen, biopsy Gleason grade group, clinical T stage, prostate volume on trans-rectal ultrasound, International Prostate Symptom Score, International Prostate Symptom Score quality of life score, and International Index of Erectile Function-5 score.

Summary background data: Sphincter-preserving rectal cancer surgery is frequently accompanied by defaecatory dysfunction known as Low anterior resection syndrome (LARS). This is distressing for patients and is an unmet clinical challenge. Methods: An international, retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing anterior resection within the ROLARR trial was undertaken. Trial participants with restoration of gastrointestinal continuity and free from disease recurrence completed the validated LARS questionnaire between August 2015 and April 2017. The primary outcome was the incidence of LARS and secondary outcome was severity (minor versus major). Results: LARS questionnaires were received from 132\/155 (85%) eligible patients. The median time from surgery to LARS assessment was 1065 days (range 174\u20131655 d). The incidence of LARS was 82.6% (n = 109\/132), which was minor in 26\/132 (19.7%) and major in 83\/132 (62.9%). The most common symptoms were incontinence to flatus (n = 86\/132; 65.2%) and defaecatory clustering (88\/132; 66.7%). In a multivariate model, predictors of major LARS were: 1\u200acm decrease in tumor height above the anal verge (OR = 1.290, 95% CI: 1.101,1.511); and an ASA grade greater than 1 (OR = 2.920, 95% CI: 1.239, 6.883). Treatment allocation (laparoscopic vs robotic) did not predict major LARS. Conclusions: LARS is a common after rectal cancer surgery and patients should be appropriately counselled preoperatively, particularly before surgery for low tumors or in comorbid populations.","authors":"W.

Herein we provided a comprehensive review of primary and redo RALP performed in children, particularly focusing on the different distribution of outcomes among the ages.\n\n\nEVIDENCE ACQUISITION\nA systematic review of the literature was performed according to PRISMA recommendations and was conducted on surgical indication and technique, intraoperative nuances, peri- and postoperative outcomes of primary and redo RALP.\n\n\nEVIDENCE SYNTHESIS\nOverall, 33 studies with 1448 patients were included for primary RALP and 7 studies with 101 patients for redo cases between 2000 and 2019. In particular, 4 studies aimed to compare RALP in different cohorts of children grouped on ages or weight and 4 studies evaluated technical feasibility and safety of RALP over laparoscopic and open approach in very young populations.

The components of computer-assisted surgery include preoperative imaging and planning, intraoperative execution, and postoperative evaluation. Ideally, these components are integrated such that sophisticated diagnostic technologies are used to create a patient-specific surgical plan. This plan is then programmed into a computer-assisted intraoperative system so that it can be precisely executed. Finally, the patient outcome is tracked longitudinally in a quantitative fashion. Computer-assisted surgery relies on the use of quantitative data rather than surgeon feel and intuition to facilitate clinical decision-making. As surgeons rely more on quantitative feedback, they must establish appropriate specifications for various operations. These specifications should be clinically relevant and must have known targets and tolerances. This overview provides examples of quantitative surgery as applied in navigated total knee replacement and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and in the more recent indication of robotic unicondylar knee replacement. Computer-assisted surgery represents a set of tools that facilitate quantitative surgery. To effectively use these tools, however, one must identify technical specifications that are clinically relevant for the various procedures; these specifications must be associated with known target values and tolerances and must have the capability of being reliably measured by computer-assisted surgery tools. Clinical and basic-science research is necessary to better define technical specifications for navigated procedures.","authors":"A. Pearle, D. Kendoff, V.

Development of robot-guidance technology has greatly enhanced the efficiency of this procedure, without sacrificing safety or precision. To date there have been very limited reports of the use of this new technology in children. The authors present their initial experience using the ROSA platform for robot-guided SEEG in a pediatric population.METHODSBetween February 2016 and October 2017, 20 consecutive patients underwent robot-guided SEEG with the ROSA robotic guidance platform as part of ongoing seizure localization and workup for medically refractory epilepsy of several different etiologies. Medical and surgical history, imaging and trajectory plans, as well as operative records were analyzed retrospectively for surgical accuracy, efficiency, safety, and epilepsy outcomes.RESULTSA total of 222 leads were placed in 20 patients, with an average of 11.1 leads per patient. The mean total case time (\u00b1 SD) was 297.95 (\u00b1 52.96) minutes and the mean operating time per lead was 10.98 minutes\/lead, with improvements in total (33.36 minutes\/lead vs 21.76 minutes\/lead) and operative (13.84 minutes\/lead vs 7.06 minutes\/lead) case times\/lead over the course of the study. The mean radial error was 1.75 (\u00b1 0.94 mm). Clinically useful data were obtained from SEEG in 95% of cases, and epilepsy surgery was indicated and performed in 95% of patients. In patients who underwent definitive epilepsy surgery with at least a 3-month follow-up, 50% achieved an Engel class I result (seizure freedom). There were no postoperative complications associated with SEEG placement and monitoring.CONCLUSIONSIn this study, the authors demonstrate that rapid adoption of robot-guided SEEG is possible even at a SEEG-na\u00efve institution, with minimal learning curve. Use of robot guidance for SEEG can lead to significantly decreased operating times while maintaining safety, the overall goals of identification of epileptogenic zones, and improved epilepsy outcomes.","authors":"Allen L.

Of all surgical procedures, thoracotomies may create the greatest demand for postoperative analgesia. Even after less-invasive techniques, such as videoand robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, postoperative pain is of considerable concern. Uncontrolled post-thoracotomy pain has important implications for a patient\u2019s recovery and can add significant morbidity and increase healthcare costs. Absence of adequate post-thoracotomy analgesia in patients undergoing lung surgery may be associated with delayed postoperative extubation. Cywinski et al conducted a logistic regression analysis on 2,068 patients who underwent open thoracotomy for pneumonectomy, lobectomy, or segmental lung resection and found that the absence of thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) was a significant predictor of delayed extubation. Based on the authors\u2019 review of the relevant literature, in the past decade no single paradigm shift in the treatment of postthoracotomy pain has been reported. Cumulatively, however, a recent body of evidence now supports an expanded armamentarium of pharmacologic and procedural interventions and an improved understanding concerning the etiology of thoracotomy pain. The aim of this review was to report on many of these numerous incremental findings by providing a concise overview and discussion of recent relevant evidence, which, in aggregate, could contribute to improved clinical outcomes.","authors":"David Rodriguez-Aldrete, K.

Both univariate and multivariate methods were used to analyze the preoperative and operative factors associated with seizure freedom.RESULTSFifty-seven children underwent a total of 64 robot-assisted procedures. The patients' mean age was 12 years, an average of 6.4 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) per patient had failed prior to implantation, and in 56% of the patients the disease was considered nonlesional. On average, children had 12.4 electrodes placed per implantation, with an implantation time of 9.6 minutes per electrode and a 10-day postoperative stay.

The objective of this work is to achieve autonomous robotic control of a continuum manipulator\u2019s position and force in a beating heart model. We present a model-less hybrid control approach that regulates the tip position\/force of manipulators with unknown kinematics\/mechanics, under unknown constraints along the manipulator\u2019s body. The algorithms estimate the Jacobian in the presence of heartbeat disturbances and sensor noise in real time, enabling closed-loop control. Using this model-less control approach, a robotic catheter autonomously traced clinically relevant paths on a simulated beating heart environment while regulating contact force. A gating procedure is used to tighten the treatment margins and improve precision. Experimental results demonstrate the capabilities of the robot (1.4\u00b11.1mm\u20131.9\u00b11.4mm tracking error) while user demonstrations show the difficulty of manually performing the same task (2.6\u00b12.0mm\u20134.3\u00b13.9mm tracking error). This new, robotically-enabled contiguous ablation method could reduce ablation path discontinuities, improve consistency of treatment, and therefore improve clinical outcomes.","authors":"Michael C.

According to the Japanese gastric cancer treatment guidelines, PPG can be performed for cT1N0M0 gastric cancer located in the middle-third of the stomach, at least 4.0 cm away from the pylorus. Although the length of the antral cuff gradually increased, from 1.5 cm during the initial use of the procedure to 3.0 cm currently, its optimal length still remains unclear. Standard procedures for the preservation of pyloric function, infra-pyloric vessels, and hepatic branch of the vagus nerve, make PPG technically more difficult and raise concerns about incomplete lymph node dissection. The short- and long-term oncological and survival outcomes of PPG were comparable to those for distal gastrectomy, but with several advantages such as a lower incidence of dumping syndrome, bile reflux, and gallstone formation, and improved nutritional status. Gastric stasis, a typical complication of PPG, can be effectively treated by balloon dilatation and stent insertion. Robot-assisted pylorus-preserving gastrectomy is feasible for EGC in the middle-third of the stomach in terms of the short-term clinical outcome. However, any benefits over laparoscopy-assisted PPG (LAPPG) from the patient's perspective have not yet been proven. An ongoing Korean multicenter randomized controlled trial (KLASS-04), which compares LAPPG and laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy for EGC in the middle-third of the stomach, may provide more clear evidence about the advantages and oncologic safety of PPG.","authors":"Seung-Young Oh, H.

We estimated the prevalence of MIRP among all prostatectomies and compared PSI incidence between MIRP and open radical prostatectomy in each year during the study. We also collected estimates of MIRP incidence attributed to the manufacturer of the da Vinci robot.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients who underwent MIRP were more likely to be white (P\u2009=\u2009.004), have fewer comorbidities (P\u2009=\u2009.02), and have undergone surgery in higher-income areas (P\u2009=\u2009.005). The incidence of MIRP was substantially lower than da Vinci manufacturer estimates. Rapid diffusion onset occurred in 2006, when MIRP accounted for 10.4% (95% CI, 10.2-10.7) of all radical prostatectomies in the United States. In 2005, MIRP was associated with an increased adjusted risk for any PSI (adjusted odds ratio, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.7; P\u2009=\u2009.02) vs open radical prostatectomy. Stratification by hospital status demonstrated similar patterns: rapid diffusion onset among teaching hospitals occurred in 2006 (11.7%; 95% CI, 11.3-12.0), with an increased risk for PSI for MIRP in 2005 (adjusted odds ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.4-5.3; P\u2009=\u2009.004), and onset among nonteaching hospitals occurred in 2008 (27.1%; 95% CI, 26.6-27.7), with an increased but nonsignificant risk for PSI in 2007 (adjusted odds ratio, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.8-5.2; P\u2009=\u2009.14).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nDuring its initial national diffusion, MIRP was associated with diminished perioperative patient safety.

Surgery is the only curative treatment, and D2 gastrectomy is the standard therapy for resectable cases. Several clinical trials have been conducted in Japan to achieve higher cure rates via extended surgery; however, despite higher morbidity, none demonstrated prolonged survival. Against this background, minimally invasive surgical approaches that preserve gastric function and improve postoperative quality of life have been developed in recent years. For early gastric cancer, endoscopic resection and laparoscopic gastrectomy have achieved remarkable success even for later-stage cases. Long-term outcomes have been investigated in large-scale, randomized controlled trials. In addition, robot-assisted gastrectomy is now more common in clinical practice. S-1, an anti-tumor drug, is a key agent for treating gastric cancer and has resulted in dramatic improvements in survival. For locally advanced gastric cancer, patients are usually treated with surgery and adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and the efficacies of various regimens have been examined in many clinical trials. For unresectable or recurrent gastric cancer, new agents such as molecular-targeted agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors have emerged as notable treatments and are now being tested in numerous clinical trials. This review provides an update on gastric cancer treatment, highlighting current individualized strategies and future perspectives.","authors":"T. Hashimoto, Y. Kurokawa, M. Mori, Y.

In this context, it is crucial to comprehensively consider all factors possibly associated with the prevention of post-RP ED throughout the entire clinical management of PCa patients. A careful assessment of both oncological and functional baseline characteristics should be carried out for each patient preoperatively. Baseline EF, together with age and the overall burden of comorbidities, has been strongly associated with the chance of post-RP EF recovery. With this goal in mind, internationally validated psychometric instruments are preferable for ensuring proper baseline EF evaluations, and questionnaires should be administered at the proper time before surgery. Careful preoperative counselling is also required, both to respect the patient's wishes and to avoid false expectations regarding eventual recovery of baseline EF. The advent of robotic surgery has led to improvements in the knowledge of prostate surgical anatomy, as reflected by the formal redefinition of nerve-sparing techniques. Overall, comparative studies have shown significantly better EF outcomes for robotic RP than for open techniques, although data from prospective trials have not always been consistent. Preclinical data and several prospective randomized trials have demonstrated the value of treating patients with oral phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5is) after surgery, with the concomitant potential benefit of early re-oxygenation of the erectile tissue, which appears to be crucial for avoiding the eventual penile structural changes that are associated with postoperative neuropraxia and ultimately result in severe ED. For patients who do not properly respond to PDE5is, proper counselling regarding intracavernous treatment should be considered, along with the further possibility of surgical treatment for ED involving the implantation of a penile prosthesis.","authors":"P.

Improved visualization, dexterity, and precision afforded by the da Vinci robot allow a precise dissection of the neurovascular bundles. We objectively assessed erectile function after robot-assisted extraperitoneal prostatectomy by using the SHIM (IIEF-5) validated questionnaire. Methods: Between July 2003 and September 2004, 150 consecutive men underwent da Vinci robot-assisted extraperitoneal radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer. The IIEF-5 questionnaire was used to assess postoperative potency in 67 patients who were at least 6 months postsurgery. Erectile function was classified as impotent (<11), moderate dysfunction (11 to 15), mild dysfunction (16 to 21), and potent (22 to 25). All patients used oral pharmacological assistance postprocedure. Results: Sixty-seven patients were available to complete the IIEF-5 questionnaire 6 months to 1 year postprostatectomy. Twelve patients were excluded from the study who abstained from all sexual activity after surgery for emotional or social reasons. Of the 55 patients evaluated, 22 (40%) were impotent, 3 (5.5%) had moderate ED, 12 (21.8%) had mild ED, and 18 (32.7%) were fully potent. The table compares IIEF-5 scores with nerve-sparing status. Of patients who had bilateral nerve sparing, 28\/45 (62.2%) had mild or no ED within 6 to 12 months postsurgery, and all expressed satisfaction with their current sexual function or rate of improvement after robotic prostatectomy. Conclusion: Robot-assisted extraperitoneal prostatectomy provides comparable outcomes to those of open surgery with regards to erectile function. Assessment of the ultimate maximal erectile function will require continued analysis, as this is likely to further improve beyond 6 to 12 months.","authors":"R. Madeb, D.

Standard treatment of benign spinal lesions is microsurgical resection. While a few publications have reported about radiosurgery for benign spinal lesions, this is the first study analyzing the outcome of robotic radiosurgery for benign spinal tumors, treated exclusively with a non-invasive, fiducial free, single-fraction setup. Thirty-six patients with spinal meningiomas or schwannomas were treated, utilizing a robotic radiosurgery system (CyberKnife\u00ae, Accuray Inc. Sunnyvale CA), and were followed prospectively. Medical history, histology, clinical symptoms and radiographic outcome were recorded. Thirty-nine spinal lesions were treated because of tumor recurrence, remnants after microsurgery, multiple lesions, or rejection of open surgery. Median age was 45 years (range 18\u201380 years). Median target volume was 3.4 cm3 (range 0.2\u201343.4 cm3). Histology revealed 28 schwannomas and 11 meningiomas (WHO grade I). All spinal levels were affected. Median prescription dose was 14 Gray (95% C.I. 13.4\u201314 Gy) to the 70% isodose. After a median follow-up of 18 months (range 6\u201350 months) no local tumor progression was detected. 20 lesions (51%) remained stable, 19 tumors (49%) decreased in size. One patient with schwannomatosis was treated repeatedly for three new tumor locations. Pain was the initial symptom in 16 of 25 schwannoma patients, and in 3 of 11 patients with meningiomas. Pain levels decreased in 8\/19 patients. All but one patient with motor deficits remained clinically stable. No myelopathic signs where found. Single-session radiosurgery for benign spinal tumors in selected patients has proven to inhibit tumor progression within the observed period without signs of early toxicity. Radiosurgery offers an additional treatment option, if microsurgery is not feasible in cases of tumor recurrence, post-resection remnants, multiple lesions, or medical comorbidity.","authors":"M.

The device is a wireless, customizable headset with an integrated surgical tracking system and transparent retinal display. This review discusses the available literature on the safety and efficacy of XVision, as well as the current state of augmented reality technology in spine surgery. Expert opinion: Augmented-reality spine surgery is an emerging technology that may increase precision, efficiency, and safety as well as decrease radiation exposure of manual and robotic computer-navigated pedicle screw insertion techniques.

However, the short- and long-term outcomes of RA versus LA have not been adequately assessed, and the advantage over the laparoscopic approach has not been demonstrated. The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of RA versus LA by means of a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature in the early experience.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA systematic search of PubMed, SCI\/SSCI, CNKI, and the Cochrane Library was performed to identify prospective randomized controlled trials and retrospective observational studies that compared RA and LA and were published between January 2006 to the end of December 2012. Outcomes of interest included demographic and clinical characteristics, perioperative variables, and complications. The meta-analysis was prepared in accordance with the Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses (QUOROM) statement.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEight trials (232 cases and 297 controls) assessing RA versus LA were considered suitable for meta-analysis, including six prospective and two retrospective studies. There was a significant trend to choose patients for the performance of RA who were associated with a lower body mass index (weighted mean difference [WMD]=-2.78\u2009kg\/m(2); 95% confidence interval [CI], -3.00 to -2.55; P<.001) and higher incidence of previous surgery (odds ratio=1.59; 95% CI, 0.99-2.54; P=.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups in any other of the demographic parameters. With regard to perioperative variables, although there was a significant difference in the operating time in favor of LA (WMD=17.52 minutes; 95% CI, 3.48-31.56; P=.01), patients having RA might benefit from significantly less blood loss (WMD=-19.00\u2009mL; 95% CI, -34.58 to -3.41; P=.02) and shorter length of hospital stay (WMD=-0.35 day; 95% CI, -0.51 to -0.19; P<.001). There were no significant differences between RA and LA with regard to conversion rates and overall complications. Sensitivity analysis performed by two methods both showed a positive reversal in the operating time with the statistical significance removed compared with the original analysis.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the early experience, our data suggest that RA, compared with LA, may be a safe and feasible option associated with less blood loss and shorter hospital stay when performed by experienced surgeons in selected patients.","authors":"K.

Perioperative outcomes and treatment success were evaluated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMedian patient age was 18 years (range 2.5-62 years). Median operative time was 136 minutes (range 109-230 min.) and there were no perioperative complications. After a median follow-up of 11 months, clinical (symptomatic) success was 100%, while radiographic success based on MAG-3 renogram was 78%. The two failures were defined by prolonged t1\/2 drainage, but neither patient has required salvage therapy as they remain asymptomatic with stable differential renal function.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMIS repair of UPJ obstruction in horseshoe kidneys is feasible and safe. Although excellent short-term clinical success is achieved, radiographic success may be lower than MIS pyeloplasty in heterotopic kidneys, possibly due to inherent differences in anatomy. Larger studies are needed to evaluate MIS pyeloplasty in this population.","authors":"Stephen Faddegon, C. Granberg, Y. Tan, P. Gargollo, J.

Our aim was to investigate the long-term HRQoL between robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery (RALS) and laparotomy (LT). Patients and Methods: A total of 120 women with high-risk stage I-II EC were randomised to RALS or LT for hysterectomy, bilateral salpingoophorectomy, pelvic and infrarenal paraaortic lymphadenectomy in the previously reported Robot-Assisted Surgery for High-Risk Endometrial Cancer trial. The HRQoL was measured with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC-QLQ-30) and its supplementary questionnaire module for endometrial cancer (QLQ-EN24) questionnaire. Women were assessed before and 12 months after surgery. In addition, the EuroQol Eq5D non-disease specific questionnaire was used for descriptive analysis. Results: There was no difference in the functional scales (including global health status) in the intention to treat analysis, though LT conferred a small clinically important difference (CID) over RALS in \u2018cognitive functioning\u2019 albeit not statistically significant \u22126 (95% CI\u221214 to 0, p\u2009=\u2009.06). LT conferred a significantly better outcome for the \u2018nausea and vomiting\u2019 item though it did not reach a CID, 4 (95% CI 1 to 7, p\u2009=\u2009.01). In the EORTC-QLQ\/QLQ-EN24, no significant differences were observed. Eq5D-3L questionnaire demonstrated a higher proportion of women reporting any extent of mobility impairment 12 months after surgery in the LT arm (p\u2009=\u2009.03). Conclusion: Overall, laparotomy and robot-assisted surgery conferred similar HRQoL 12 months after comprehensive staging for high-risk EC.","authors":"S. Salehi, Y.

Among them, nine patients underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic antegrade inguinal lymphadenectomy (robot-assisted group) and 10 patients underwent open inguinal lymphadenectomy (open group). In the robot-assisted group, preoperative preparation, patient position, robot placement, design of operating channel and establishment of operating space are described. Key surgical procedures and techniques are also summarized. In addition, the number of lymph nodes removed, postoperative complications and follow-up in both groups were statistically analyzed.ResultsFor the 9 patients in the robot-assisted group, surgery was successfully accomplished at 17 sides without intraoperative conversion to open surgery.

The robotic arms of the surgical system were placed between the lower limbs of each patient. There was no need to re-position the robotic arms during bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy. This simplified the procedure and reduced the use of trocars. If necessary, pelvic lymphadenectomy could be performed simultaneously using the original trocar position.","authors":"Hua-liang Yu, Yongliang Lu, Yi Xiao, Jiaxiang Guo, Xiaotao Yin, Yu Yang, Hongwei Wang, Jiangping Gao","year":2019,"url":"https:\/\/www.semanticscholar.org\/paper\/4043e158e17e8523a9a58995842d0507343eb47f"},{"title":"Robot-Assisted Transversus Abdominis Plane Block: Description of the Technique and Comparative Analysis.","abstract":"BACKGROUND\nSeveral randomized clinical trials have shown the efficacy of percutaneous transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block in decreasing pain after open and minimally invasive surgeries.

The aim of the present study is to compare the accuracy of the SpineAssist robot system with conventional fluoroscopy-guided pedicle screw placement.\n\n\nMETHODS\nNinety-five patients suffering from degenerative disease and requiring elective lumbar instrumentation were included in the study. The robot cohort (Group I; 55 patients, 244 screws) consisted of an initial open robot-assisted subgroup (Subgroup IA; 17 patients, 83 screws) and a percutaneous cohort (Subgroup IB, 38 patients, 161 screws). In these groups, pedicle screws were placed under robotic guidance and lateral fluoroscopic control. In the fluoroscopy-guided cohort (Group II; 40 patients, 163 screws) screws were inserted using anatomical landmarks and lateral fluoroscopic guidance. The primary outcome measure was accuracy of screw placement on the Gertzbein-Robbins scale (Grade A to E and R [revised]). Secondary parameters were duration of surgery, blood loss, cumulative morphine, and length of stay.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the robot group (Group I), a perfect trajectory (A) was observed in 204 screws (83.6%). The remaining screws were graded B (n = 19 [7.8%]), C (n = 9 [3.7%]), D (n = 4 [1.6%]), E (n = 2 [0.8%]), and R (n = 6 [2.5%]). In the fluoroscopy-guided group (Group II), a completely intrapedicular course graded A was found in 79.8% (n = 130). The remaining screws were graded B (n = 12 [7.4%]), C (n = 10 [6.1%]), D (n = 6 [3.7%]), and E (n = 5 [3.1%]). The comparison of \"clinically acceptable\" (that is, A and B screws) was neither different between groups (I vs II [p = 0.19]) nor subgroups (Subgroup IA vs IB [p = 0.81]; Subgroup IA vs Group II [p = 0.53]; Subgroup IB vs Group II [p = 0.20]). Blood loss was lower in the robot-assisted group than in the fluoroscopy-guided group, while duration of surgery, length of stay, and cumulative morphine dose were not statistically different.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRobot-guided pedicle screw placement is a safe and useful tool for assisting spine surgeons in degenerative spine cases. Nonetheless, technical difficulties remain and fluoroscopy backup is advocated.","authors":"B. Schatlo, G. Molliqaj, V. Cuvinciuc, M. Kotowski, K. Schaller, E.
