[{"title":"Clinical Outcomes of Robotic Surgery Compared to Conventional Surgical Approaches (Laparoscopic or Open)","abstract":"Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text Objective: Describe clinical outcomes (eg, postoperative complications, survival) after robotic surgery compared to open or laparoscopic surgery. Background: Robotic surgery utilization has increased over the years across a wide range of surgical procedures. However, evidence supporting improved clinical outcomes after robotic surgery is limited. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of systematic reviews from inception to January 2019 for systematic reviews describing postoperative outcomes after robotic surgery. We qualitatively described patient outcomes of commonly performed robotic procedures: radical prostatectomy, hysterectomy, lobectomy, thymectomy, rectal resection, partial nephrectomy, distal gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, hepatectomy, distal pancreatectomy, and cholecystectomy. Results: One hundred fifty-four systematic reviews included 336 studies and 18 randomized controlled trials reporting on patient outcomes after robotic compared to laparoscopic or open procedures. Data from the randomized controlled trials demonstrate that robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy offered fewer biochemical recurrence and improvement in quality of recovery and pain scores only up to 6 weeks postoperatively compared to open radical prostatectomy. When compared to laparoscopic prostatectomy, robotic surgery offered improved urinary and sexual functions. Robotic surgery for endometrial cancer had fewer conversion to open compared to laparoscopic. Otherwise, robotic surgery outcomes were similar to conventional surgical approaches for other procedures except for radical hysterectomy where minimally invasive approaches may result in patient harm compared to open approach. Conclusion: Robotic surgery has been widely incorporated into practise despite limited supporting evidence. More rigorous research focused on patient-important benefits is needed before further expansion of robotic surgery.","authors":"H. Muaddi, M\u00e9lanie El Hafid, W.

Improved surgeon experience allows very large or very complex resections, such as in a previously irradiated field where spontaneous healing is functionally insufficient or is at high risk of postoperative complications. We demonstrated very satisfactory feasibility and postoperative outcomes with a free flap microvascular reconstruction in this category of patients. TORS and free flap reconstruction has a place as a standard of care in a number of complex situations. Abstract We reviewed the indications, peroperative feasibility, and postoperative clinical outcomes of our first 50 consecutive patients who underwent free flap reconstruction after TORS for complex pharyngeal defects at our institution. We analyzed indications according to previous radiotherapy, the size of the resection, and the transoral exposure of critical structures. We reviewed surgical data, postoperative complications, and functional outcomes comprising tracheostomy and alimentation management. Indications were upfront surgery (34%), a second primary surgery after radiotherapy (28%), or salvage surgery after chemoradiotherapy failure (38%). Localizations were the tongue base (44%), tonsillar fossa (28%), pharyngeal wall (22%), and soft palate (6%). T-classifications were T1 (6%), T2 (52%), T3 (20%), and T4 (22%). The mean length of the surgery was 574 min. Two patients were intraoperatively converted to a conventional approach at the beginning of the learning curve. In conclusion, TORS and free flap reconstruction in complex situations were associated with low rates of postoperative complications and satisfactory functional outcomes. They were, however, associated with a renewed learning curve.","authors":"P. Gorphe, S. Temam, A. Moya-Plana, N. Leymarie, F. Kolb, A. Bout-Roumazeilles, Q. Qassemyar, N. Benmoussa, J.

This study examines the short-term clinical outcomes of an international RCS training programme (the European Academy of Robotic Colorectal Surgery\u2014EARCS). Consecutive cases from 26 European colorectal units who conducted RCS between 2014 and 2018 were included in this study. The baseline characteristics and short-term outcomes of cases performed by EARCS delegates during training were analysed and compared with cases performed by EARCS graduates and proctors. Data from 1130 RCS procedures were collected and classified into three cohort groups (323 training, 626 graduates and 181 proctors). The training cases conversion rate was 2.2% and R1 resection rate was 1.5%. The three groups were similar in terms of baseline characteristics with the exception of malignant cases and rectal resections performed. With the exception of operative time, blood loss and hospital stay (training vs. graduate vs. proctor: operative time 302, 265, 255 min, p\u2009<\u20090.001; blood loss 50, 50, 30 ml, p\u2009<\u20090.001; hospital stay 7, 6, 6 days, p\u2009=\u20090.003), all remaining short-term outcomes (conversion, 30-day reoperation, 30-day readmission, 30-day mortality, clinical anastomotic leak, complications, R1 resection and lymph node yield) were comparable between the three groups. Colorectal surgeons learning how to perform RCS under the EARCS-structured training pathway can safely achieve short-term clinical outcomes comparable to their trainers and overcome the learning process in a way that minimises patient harm.","authors":"S.

METHODS: In this prospective randomized study from 2015 to 2017, eighty-nine patients with endometrial carcinoma that was clinically restricted to the uterus were randomized in robotic surgery (44 cases) and traditional laparoscopic surgery (45 cases). We compared the number of retrieved lymph nodes, total time of surgery, time of each surgical step, blood loss, length of hospital stay, major and minor complications, conversion rates and costs. RESULTS: The ages of the patients ranged from 47 to 69 years. The median body mass index was 31.1 (21.4-54.2) in the robotic surgery arm and 31.6 (22.9-58.6) in the traditional laparoscopic arm. The median tumor sizes were 4.0 (1.5-10.0) cm and 4.0 (0.0-9.0) cm in the robotic and traditional laparoscopic surgery groups, respectively. The median total numbers of lymph nodes retrieved were 19 (3-61) and 20 (4-34) in the robotic and traditional laparoscopic surgery arms, respectively. The median total duration of the whole procedure was 319.5 (170-520) minutes in the robotic surgery arm and 248 (85-465) minutes in the traditional laparoscopic arm. Eight major complications were registered in each group. The total cost was 41% higher for robotic surgery than for traditional laparoscopic surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Robotic surgery for endometrial cancer presented equivalent perioperative morbidity to that of traditional laparoscopic surgery. The duration and total cost of robotic surgery were higher than those of traditional laparoscopic surgery.","authors":"A. S. E. Silva, J. P. M. de Carvalho, C. Anton, R. Fernandes, E. Baracat, J.

Prospective randomized clinical trials comparing laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) and RG are thus required.\n\n\nObjective\nTo compare the short-term surgical outcomes of RG with those of LG for patients with gastric cancer.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nIn this phase 3, prospective superiority randomized clinical trial of RG vs LG regarding reduction of complications, 241 patients with resectable gastric cancer (clinical stages I-III) were enrolled between April 1, 2018, and October 31, 2020.\n\n\nInterventions\nLG vs RG.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nThe primary end point was the incidence of postoperative intra-abdominal infectious complications. Secondary end points were incidence of any complications, surgical results, postoperative courses, and oncologic outcomes. The modified intention-to-treat population excluded patients who had been randomized and met the postrandomization exclusion criteria. There was also a per-protocol population for analysis of postoperative complications.\n\n\nResults\nThis study enrolled 241 patients, with 236 patients in the modified intention-to-treat population (150 men [63.6%]; mean [SD] age, 70.8 [10.7] years). There was no significant difference in the incidence of intra-abdominal infectious complications (per-protocol population: 10 of 117 [8.5%] in the LG group vs 7 of 113 [6.2%] in the RG group). Of 241 patients, 122 were randomly assigned to the LG group, and 119 patients were randomly assigned to the RG group. Two of the 122 patients (1.6%) in the LG group converted from LG to open surgery, and 4 of 119 patients (3.4%) in the RG group converted from RG to open or laparoscopic surgery, with no significant difference. Finally, 117 patients in the LG group completed the procedure, and 113 in the RG group completed the procedure; these populations were defined as the per-protocol population. The overall incidence of postoperative complications of grade II or higher was significantly higher in the LG group (23 [19.7%]) than in the RG group (10 [8.8%]) (P\u2009=\u2009.02). Even in analysis limited to grade IIIa or higher, the complication rate was still significantly higher in the LG group (19 [16.2%]) than in the RG group (6 [5.3%]) (P\u2009=\u2009.01).\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nThis study found no reduction of intra-abdominal infectious complications with RG compared with LG for gastric cancer.\n\n\nTrial Registration\numin.ac.jp\/ctr Identifier: UMIN000031536.","authors":"T.

Methods: A retrospective single-center study was conducted comparing consecutively performed robotic-assisted and laparoscopic surgeries for rectal cancer between 1 January 2016 and 31 September 2021. In total, 125 adult patients with sporadic rectal adenocarcinoma (distal extent \u2264 15 cm from the anal verge) underwent surgery where 66 were operated on robotically and 59 laparoscopically. Results: Severe postoperative complications occurred less frequently with robotic-assisted compared with laparoscopic surgery, as indicated by Clavien\u2013Dindo classification grades 3b\u20135 (13.6% vs. 30.5%, p = 0.029). Multiple logistic regression analyses after backward selection revealed that robotic-assisted surgery was associated with a lower rate of total (Clavien\u2013Dindo grades 1\u20135) (OR = 0.355; 95% CI 0.156\u20130.808; p = 0.014) and severe postoperative complications (Clavien\u2013Dindo grades 3b\u20135) (OR = 0.243; 95% CI 0.088\u20130.643; p = 0.005).

The primary outcome measure (surgical accuracy) has previously been reported, and, along with secondary outcomes, were collected at one-, two-, and five-year timepoints. Analysis of five-year results and longitudinal analysis for all timepoints was performed to compare the two groups. Results Overall, 104 (80%) patients of the original 130 who received surgery were available at five years (55 robotic, 49 manual). Both procedures reported successful results over all outcomes. At five years, there were no statistical differences between the groups in any of the patient reported or clinical outcomes. There was a lower reintervention rate in the robotic arm-assisted group with 0% requiring further surgery compared with six (9%) of the manual group requiring additional surgical intervention (p < 0.001). Conclusion This study has shown excellent clinical outcomes in both groups with no statistical or clinical differences in the patient-reported outcome measures. The notable difference was the lower reintervention rate at five years for roboticarm-assisted UKA when compared with a manual approach.

This systematic review compared robotic VHR with laparoscopic and open approaches. Methods This systematic review was undertaken in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for articles with terms relating to \u2018robot-assisted\u2019, \u2018cost effectiveness\u2019, and \u2018ventral hernia\u2019 or \u2018incisional hernia\u2019 from 1 January 2010 to 10 November 2020. Intraoperative and postoperative outcomes, pain, recurrence, and cost data were extracted for narrative analysis. Results Of 25 studies that met the inclusion criteria, three were RCTs and 22 observational studies. Robotic VHR was associated with a longer duration of operation than open and laparoscopic repairs, but with fewer transfusions, shorter hospital stay, and lower complication rates than open repair. Robotic VHR was more expensive than laparoscopic repair, but not significantly different from open surgery in terms of cost. There were no significant differences in rates of intraoperative complication, conversion to open surgery, surgical-site infection, readmission, mortality, pain, or recurrence between the three approaches. Conclusion Robotic VHR was associated with a longer duration of operation, fewer transfusions, a shorter hospital stay, and fewer complications compared with open surgery. Robotic VHR had higher costs and a longer operating time than laparoscopic repair. Randomized or matched data with standardized reporting, long-term outcomes, and cost-effectiveness analyses are still required to weigh the clinical benefits against the cost of robotic VHR.","authors":"Linda Ye, C.

This population-based cohort study aimed to compare rates of textbook outcomes (TOs) and survival from robotic minimally invasive techniques for esophagogastric cancer. Data from the United States National Cancer Database (NCDB) (2010\u20132017) were used to identify patients with non-metastatic esophageal or gastric cancer receiving open surgery (to the esophagus, n = 11,442; stomach, n = 22,183), laparoscopic surgery (to the esophagus [LAMIE], n = 4827; stomach [LAMIG], n = 6359), or robotic surgery (to the esophagus [RAMIE], n = 1657; stomach [RAMIG], n = 1718). The study defined TOs as 15 or more lymph nodes examined, margin-negative resections, hospital stay less than 21 days, no 30-day readmissions, and no 90-day mortalities. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox analyses were used to account for treatment selection bias. Patients receiving robotic surgery were more commonly treated in high-volume academic centers with advanced clinical T and N stage disease. From 2010 to 2017, TO rates increased for esophageal and gastric cancer treated via all surgical techniques. Compared with open surgery, significantly higher TO rates were associated with RAMIE (odds ratio [OR], 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27\u20131.58) and RAMIG (OR 1.30; 95% CI 1.17\u20131.45). For esophagectomy, long-term survival was associated with both TO (hazard ratio [HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.60\u20130.67) and RAMIE (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.84\u20131.00). For gastrectomy, long-term survival was associated with TO (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.56\u20130.60) and both LAMIG (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.85\u20130.94) and RAMIG (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.81\u20130.96). Subset analysis in high-volume centers confirmed similar findings. Despite potentially adverse learning curve effects and more advanced tumor stages captured during the study period, both RAMIE and RAMIG performed in mostly high-volume centers were associated with improved TO and long-term survival. Therefore, consideration for wider adoption but a well-designed phase 3 randomized controlled trial (RCT) is required for a full evaluation of the benefits conferred by robotic techniques for esophageal and gastric cancers.","authors":"S.

We determined the trends in adoption of minimally invasive surgery and 5-year overall survival outcomes after open, laparoscopic-assisted, and robotic-assisted hysterectomy for stage II uterine cancer with cervical stromal involvement. Methods Data for patients with stage II uterine cancer were acquired from the National Cancer Database from 2010 to 2015. \u03c72 testing, Kaplan\u2013Meier methods, and Cox models were used for statistical analyses. Results Of 2949 patients, 44.3% underwent open hysterectomy, 13.9% underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy, and 41.8% underwent robotic hysterectomy. The proportion of robotic cases increased from 26.8% in 2010 to 48.3% in 2015 (annual percent change 10.1%), with a decrease in open hysterectomy from 63.3% to 34.3% (annual percent change \u201312.5%). The overall 5-year survival was 77.6% in robotic, 76.8% in laparoscopic, and 72.5% in open hysterectomy (p=0.045); however, after adjusting for known prognostic factors, robotic (HR 1.00, 95%\u2009CI 0.82 to 1.21; p=0.97) and laparoscopic hysterectomy (HR 1.09, 95%\u2009CI 0.83 to 1.44; p=0.54) did not portend for improved survival compared with open hysterectomy. Black women (HR 1.59, 95%\u2009CI 1.25 to 2.02; p<0.001) and individuals with co-morbidities (HR 1.45, 95%\u2009CI 1.21 to 1.75, p<0.001) had worse adjusted survival and the highest rates of open hysterectomy. Conclusion The use of minimally invasive surgery for stage II uterine cancer has increased over time, with comparable adjusted 5-year survival after robotic or laparoscopic hysterectomy compared with open hysterectomy. Black women and those with co-morbidities had lowest rates of minimally invasive surgery and the poorest adjusted survival.","authors":"M. K. Abel, J. Chan, S. Chow, K. Darcy, C. Tian, D. Kapp, A.

This is especially true for the robotic approach and is one of the main reasons that has prevented its wider acceptance among hospitals and surgeons. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes and economic impact of robotic and open liver surgery in a single institution. Methods: Sixty-eight robotic and 55 open hepatectomies were performed at our institution between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2013. Demographics, perioperative data, and postoperative outcomes were collected and compared between the two groups. An independent company performed the financial analysis. The economic parameters comprised direct variable costs, direct fixed costs, and indirect costs. Results: Mean estimated blood loss was significantly less in the robotic group (438 versus 727.8\u2009mL; P\u2009=\u2009.038). Overall morbidity was significantly lower in the robotic group (22% versus 40%; P\u2009=\u2009.047). Clavien III\/IV complications were also lower, with 4.4% in the robotic versus 16.3% in the open group (P\u2009=\u2009.043). The length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) was shorter for patients who underwent a robotic procedure (2.1 versus 3.3 days; P\u2009=\u2009.004). The average total cost, including readmissions, was $37,518 for robotic surgery and $41,948 for open technique. Conclusions: Robotic liver resections had less overall morbidity, ICU, and hospital stay. This translates into decreased average costs for robotic surgery. These procedures are financially comparable to open resections and do not represent a financial burden to the hospital.","authors":"D. Daskalaki, Raquel Gonzalez-Heredia, Marc Brown, F. Bianco, I.

In this study, we report our experience in robotic lobectomy for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer, with particular attention to oncological outcomes and nodal upstaging rate. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent lobectomy and radical lymphadenectomy at our Institute between 2016 and 2020. We selected 299 patients who met the inclusion criteria of the study. We analyzed the demographic features of the groups as well as their nodal upstaging rate after pathological examination. Then, we analyzed disease-free and overall survival of the entire enrolled patient population and we compared the same oncological outcomes in the upstaging and the non-upstaging group. Results: A total of 299 patients who underwent robotic lobectomy were enrolled. After surgery, 55 patients reported nodal hilar or mediastinal upstaging. The 3-year overall survival of the entire population was 82.8%. The upstaging group and the non-upstaging group were homogeneous for age, gender, smoking habits, clinical stage, tumor site, tumor histology. The non-upstaging group had better OS (p = 0.004) and DFS (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Our results show that robotic surgery is a safe and feasible approach for the treatment of early-stage NSCLC, especially for its accuracy in mediastinal lymphadenectomy. The oncological outcomes were encouraging and consistent with previous findings.","authors":"F. Gallina, Riccardo Taj\u00e8, D. Forcella, Felicita Corzani, V. Cerasoli, P. Visca, C. Coccia, F.

However, patients undergoing robotic colorectal surgery were more frequently male (P = 0.004) with earlier T stage tumours (P = 0.02) if cancer present. Procedures took longer in cases of robotic surgery (302 vs 130 min; P < 0.001), and patients in this group were more frequently admitted to intensive care units (P < 0.001). Overall length of stay was longer (7 vs 5 days; P = 0.03) and consumable cost was A$2728 higher per patient in the robotic surgery group.Conclusion Robotic colorectal surgery appears to be safe compared with current laparoscopic techniques, albeit with longer procedure times and overall length of stay, more frequent intensive care admissions and higher consumables cost.What is known about the topic?Robotic surgery is an emerging alternative to traditional laparoscopic approaches in colorectal surgery. International trials suggest the two techniques are equivalent in safety.What does this paper add?This is an original cohort study examining clinical outcomes in Australian colorectal robotic surgery. The data suggest it may be safe, but this paper demonstrates key issues in the implementation and audit of novel surgical technologies in relatively low-volume centres.What are implications for practitioners?In our study, patients undergoing robotic colorectal surgery at a single centre in Australia had equivalent measured clinical outcomes to those undergoing laparoscopic surgery. However, practitioners may counsel patients that robotic procedures are typically longer and more expensive, with a longer overall hospital admission and a higher likelihood of intensive care admission.","authors":"B.

However, the alignment concept that most effectively enhances patient satisfaction remains unclear. This study compares the clinical outcomes of patients who underwent functionally aligned RTKA (FA-RTKA), mechanically aligned conventional TKA (MA-CTKA) and mechanically aligned RTKA (MA-RTKA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nA prospectively collected database was retrospectively reviewed for patients who underwent primary TKA for knee osteoarthritis. One hundred and forty-seven knees were performed with MA-CTKA, followed by 72 consecutive knees performed with MA-RTKA, and subsequently, 70 consecutive knees performed with FA-RTKA were enrolled. After 1:1 propensity score matching of patient demographics, 70 knees were finally included in each group. The extent of additional soft tissue release during surgery was identified, and the Coronal Plane Alignment of the Knee classification was utilised to categorise the alignment. At the 1-year follow-up, patient-reported outcomes, including the pain Visual Analogue Scale, Knee Society Score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index and Forgotten Joint Score-12, were also compared among the groups.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe FA-RTKA group showed significantly less additional soft tissue release than the MA-CTKA and MA-RTKA groups (15.7%, 38.6% and 35.7%, respectively; p\u2009=\u20090.006). Statistically significant differences in functional scores were observed in the postoperative 1-year clinical outcomes in favour of the FA-RTKA group, which had a significantly larger percentage of knees that maintained constitutional alignment and joint line obliquity than those of the other groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFunctionally aligned TKA showed superior 1-year postoperative patient-reported outcomes compared with those of conventional and robotic arm-assisted mechanically aligned TKA. Therefore, the advantage of RTKA is maximised when the implant positioning is based on functional alignment. The application of RTKA with mechanical alignment has been proven ineffective in improving the clinical outcomes of patients.\n\n\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE\nLevel III.","authors":"Jong Hwa Lee, Seungcheol Kwon, J.

With the recent introduction of new robotic platforms, several studies reported the feasibility of different surgical procedures. The aim of this systematic review is to highlight the current clinical practice with the new robotic platforms in general surgery. Materials and Methods: A grey literature search was performed on the Internet to identify the available robotic systems. A PRISMA compliant systematic review was conducted for all English articles up to 10 February 2023 searching the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. Clinical outcomes, training process, operating surgeon background, cost-analysis, and specific registries were evaluated. Results: A total of 103 studies were included for qualitative synthesis after the full-text screening. Of the fifteen robotic platforms identified, only seven were adopted in a clinical environment. Out of 4053 patients, 2819 were operated on with a new robotic device. Hepatopancreatobiliary surgery specialty performed the majority of procedures, and the most performed procedure was cholecystectomy. Globally, 109 emergency surgeries were reported. Concerning the training process, only 45 papers reported the background of the operating surgeon, and only 28 papers described the training process on the surgical platform. Only one cost-analysis compared a new robot to the existing reference. Two manufacturers promoted a specific registry to collect clinical outcomes. Conclusions: This systematic review highlights the feasibility of most surgical procedures in general surgery using the new robotic platforms. Adoption of these new devices in general surgery is constantly growing with the extension of regulatory approvals. Standardization of the training process and the assessment of skills\u2019 transferability is still lacking.

This study aimed to analyze the early clinical outcomes of patients undergoing totally endoscopic robotic MV repair (TERMVR) as a landmark national study for this procedure.Methods\u2004and\u2004Results:A total of 213 patients (152 men; mean age, 55\u00b111 years) underwent TERMVR during May 2014 to December 2018. Preoperative demographics, operative profiles, and postoperative outcomes, including follow-up echocardiography, were analyzed. Successful TERMVR was achieved in all patients. Operation, cardiopulmonary bypass, and aortic cross-clamp times were 192\u00b149.8, 127\u00b123.8, and 70.1\u00b116.2 min, respectively. Intraoperative transfusion was performed in 20 patients (10%). There were no in-hospital deaths. All patients were alive during the median follow-up period of 255 days (interquartile range, 32.5-208 days). Freedom from recurrence of MR >grade 2+ was 97.3%, 95.0%, and 90.7% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTERMVR is an effective and safe procedure with acceptable early postoperative outcomes.","authors":"T.

Among 39 patients who underwent the pancreatoduodenectomy, the average operative time was 395.3\u00b1118.8 min, and the mean intra-operative blood loss was 447.3\u00b1269.9 mL. Among 31 patients who underwent the distal pancreatectomy (DP), the average operative time was 185.5\u00b174.1 min, and the mean intra-operative blood loss was 267.1\u00b1305.3 mL. In two patients who received the middle pancreatectomy (MP), the average operative time was 225 min and mean intra-operative blood loss was 100 mL. Among all the 72 patients, an average of 4.2\u00b12.6 lymph nodes were dissected, with an average hospital stay of 22.6\u00b110.7 days. Complications were observed in 18 patients, which included pancreatic fistula (n=11), bile leak (n=5), anastomotic bleeding (n=2), pancreatic fistula complicated with portal vein thrombosis (n=1), and anastomotic bleeding complicated with acute renal failure (n=1). Except that one patient died due to post-operative bleeding and acute renal failure, all the other patients were cured after conservative treatment. These 72 patients were followed for 1-45 (15.6\u00b15.8) months, during which 10 patients died. Eleven patients suffered from recurrence or metastasis, among which 6 had local recurrence, 4 had liver metastasis, and 1 had ascites accompnaied with incision site tumor metastasis.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRadical resection of PDAC by robotic surgical system is safe and feasible. It has less surgical trauma and enables faster post-operative recovery, and therefore can achieve the lymph node dissection scope and tumor resection margin required by the standards of radical resection for pancreatic cancer. Nevertheless, its long-term efficacy requires further validation.","authors":"Q.

These results were compared with a cohort of patients who underwent TKA without robotic assistance performed by the same surgeon prior to the introduction of this technology. Materials and Methods\u2003A cohort of consecutive patients undergoing primary TKA for the diagnosis of osteoarthritis by a single fellowship trained orthopaedic surgeon over a 39-month period was identified. Patients who underwent TKA during the year that this surgeon transitioned his entire knee arthroplasty practice to robotic assistance were excluded to eliminate selection bias and control for the learning curve. All patients received the same prosthesis and postoperative pain protocol. Patients that required intubation for failed spinal anesthetic were excluded. A final population of 492 TKAs was identified. Of these, 290 underwent TKA without robotic assistance and 202 underwent robotic arm-assisted TKA. Patient demographic characteristics and short-term clinical data were analyzed. Results\u2003Robotic arm-assisted TKA was associated with shorter length of stay (2.3 vs. 2.6 days, p\u2009<\u20090.001), a 50% reduction in morphine milligram equivalent utilization (from 214 to 103, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and a mean increase in procedure time of 9.3\u2009minutes (p\u2009<\u20090.001). There was one superficial infection in the nonrobotic cohort and there were no deep postoperative infections in either cohort. There were no manipulations under anesthesia in the robotic cohort while there were six in the nonrobotic cohort. Additionally, there were no significant differences in emergency department visits, readmissions, or return to the operating room. Conclusion\u2003This analysis corroborates existing literature suggesting that robotic arm-assisted TKA can be correlated with improved short-term clinical outcomes. This study reports on a single surgeon's experience with regard to analgesic requirements, length of stay, pain scores, and procedure time following a complete transition to robotic arm-assisted TKA. These results underscore the importance of continued evaluation of clinical outcomes as robotic arthroplasty technology continues to grow.","authors":"C. King, Mark L. Jordan, Alexander T.

A systematic review and meta-analysis","abstract":"Background Robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) is an emerging technology that claims to position implants with very high accuracy. However, there is currently limited data in literature on whether this improved accuracy leads to better long-term clinical outcomes. This systematic review compares the outcomes of THA done with the help of robotic assistance (RA) to those done with conventional manual techniques (MTs). Methods Four electronic databases were searched for eligible articles that directly compared robot-assisted THA to manual THA and had data on the radiological or clinical outcomes of both. Data on various outcome parameters were collected. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model with 95% CIs. Results A total of 17 articles were found eligible for inclusion, and 3600 cases were analysed. Mean operating time in the RA group was significantly longer than in the MT group. RA resulted in significantly more acetabular cups being placed inside Lewinnek\u2019s and Callanan\u2019s safe zones (p<0.001) and had significantly reduced limb length discrepancy compared with MT. There were no statistically significant differences in the two groups in terms of incidence of perioperative complications, need for revision surgery and long-term functional outcome. Conclusion RA leads to highly accurate implant placement and leads to significantly reduced limb length discrepancies. However, the authors do not recommend robot-assisted techniques for routine THAs due to lack of adequate long-term follow-up data, prolonged surgical times and no significant differences in the rate of complications and implant survivorship compared with conventional MTs.","authors":"Vishal Kumar, Sandeep Patel, V.

Methods: a search of the studies comparing robotic and laparoscopic or open esophagectomy was performed trough the medical libraries, with the search string \u201crobotic and (oesophagus OR esophagus OR esophagectomy OR oesophagectomy)\u201d. Outcomes were: postoperative complications rate (anastomotic leakage, bleeding, wound infection, pneumonia, recurrent laryngeal nerves paralysis, chylotorax, mortality), intraoperative outcomes (mean blood loss, operative time and conversion), oncologic outcomes (harvested nodes, R0 resection, recurrence) and recovery outcomes (length of hospital stay). Results: Robotic approach is superior to open surgery in terms of blood loss p = 0.001, wound infection rate, p = 0.002, pneumonia rate, p = 0.030 and mean number of harvested nodes, p < 0.0001 and R0 resection rate, p = 0.043. Similarly, robotic approach is superior to conventional laparoscopy in terms of mean number of harvested nodes, p = 0.001 pneumonia rate, p = 0.003. Conclusions: robotic surgery could be considered superior to both open surgery and conventional laparoscopy. These encouraging results should promote the diffusion of the robotic surgery, with the creation of randomized trials to overcome selection bias.","authors":"M. Manigrasso, S. Vertaldi, A.

As we know, the ROLARR randomized clinical trial (RCT), the biggest international multicenter RCT comparing the effect of robotic-assisted vs conventional laparoscopic for rectal cancer, did not find any significant differences in the risk of conversion to open laparotomy and postoperative complications between groups. In addition, a large retrospective single-center comparative study from China also showed similar short-term outcomes between roboticassisted surgery (n 1\u20444 556) and laparoscopic group (n 1\u20444 1029). On the contrast, using large sample size and including the consecutive rectal cancer patients, the authors concluded that robotic rectal cancer surgery improved the short-term outcomes when compared with laparoscopic surgery. The appearance of the present study is of great significance to surgeons performing rectal cancer surgery. However, the discussion on why the above phenomenon occurs in the present study seems to be lacking. In addition, we have the following comments. First, the consecutive inclusion of all rectal cancer patients may decrease the selection bias in a degree. However, the authors seem to miss the effect of the learning curve on robotic surgery. Based on 506 cases of robotic rectal cancer surgery performed by a single surgeon, Lee concluded that surgical outcomes improved after the 177th case. In the present study, the authors did not describe the surgeons who performed the 317 cases of robotic surgery.

This study describes the cortical and pedicle screw accuracy for the first 54 cases where navigated robotic assistance was used in a surgical setting. This is a retrospective chart review of the initial 54 patients undergoing spine surgery with pedicle and cortical screws using robotic guidance with navigation. A computed tomography (CT)-based Gertzbein and Robbins System (GRS) was used to classify pedicle screw accuracy. Screw tip, tail, and angulation offsets were measured using image overlay analysis. Screw malposition, reposition, and return to operating room rates were collected. 1 of the first 54 cases was a revision surgery and was excluded from the study. Ten screws were placed without the robot due to surgeon discretion and were excluded for the data analysis of 292 screws. Only 0.68% (2\/292) of the robot-assisted screws was repositioned based on surgeon discretion. Based on the GRS CT-based grading, 98.3% (287\/292) were graded A or B, 1.0% (3\/292) screws were graded C, and only 0.7% (2\/292) screws was graded D. The average offset from preoperative plan to actual final placement was 1.9\u00a0mm from the tip, 2.3\u00a0mm from the tail, and 2.8\u00b0 of angulation.

Minimally invasive gastrectomy is currently considered a valid option to treat gastric cancer and is gaining increasing acceptance. Recent reports have suggested that the application of robots may confer some advantages over conventional laparoscopy, but the role of robotic surgery in clinical practice is still uncertain. We aimed to critically review the relevant evidence comparing robotic to standard laparoscopic surgery in performing radical gastrectomy. Methods. The Pubmed\/Medline electronic databases were searched through February 2021. Paper conference and the English language was the only restriction applied to our search strategy. Results. According to the existing data, robotic gastrectomy seems to provide some benefits in terms of blood loss, rate of conversion, procedure-specific postoperative morbidity, and length of hospital stay. Robotic gastrectomy is also associated with a longer duration of surgery and a higher economic burden as compared to its laparoscopic counterpart. No significant differences have been disclosed in terms of long-term survivals, while the number of lymph nodes retrieved with robotic gastrectomy is generally higher than that of laparoscopy. Conclusions. The current literature suggests that robotic radical gastrectomy appears as competent as the conventional laparoscopic procedure and may provide some clinical advantages. However, due to the relative paucity of high-level evidence, it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions.","authors":"G. Giuliani, F. Guerra, L. de Franco, L. Salvischiani, Roberto Benigni, A.

Dedicated centers have continuously evolved and further developed this minimally invasive method of coronary bypass surgery. A literature review was conducted to assess intra- and postoperative outcomes of TECAB. PubMed returned 19 comprehensive articles on TECAB. Investigation was focused on perioperative outcome parameters, i.e.: operative time, conversion to larger incision, revision for bleeding, atrial fibrillation, stroke, acute renal failure, and mortality. Outcome from the analysis of 2,397 reported cases showed an average operative time of 291 \u00b1 57 minutes (range 112 to 1,050), conversion rate to larger incisions at 11.5%, and perioperative mortality at 0.8%. Pooled data demonstrated 4.2% operative revision rate due to postoperative hemorrhage, 1.0% stroke incidence, 1.6% acute renal failure, and 13.3% de novo atrial fibrillation. The mean length of hospital stay measured 5.8 \u00b1 1.7 days. Conversion rates and operative times decreased over time. According to data in the literature, coronary bypass surgery carried out in completely endoscopic fashion utilizing robotic assistance can require relatively extensive operative times and conversion rates are somewhat higher than in other robotic cardiac surgery. However, major postoperative events lie in an acceptable range. TECAB remains the surgical revascularization method with the least tissue trauma and represents an opportunity for coronary artery bypass grafting via port access. Rates of major complications are at least similar to conventional surgical access procedures.","authors":"L. G\u00f6b\u00f6l\u00f6s, Jehad Ramahi, A. Obeso, T. Bartel, M. Hogan, M.

Leonardo designed, and possibly built, the first articulated humanoid robot in 1495 in Milan (Italy) [1], but the term robot was coined only in 1921 by Karel \u010capek, who staged a play with artificial people (\u201crobota\u201d) working for humans in a factory [2]. Indeed, robots embody one of the main human dreams: having machines replacing man in dangerous or heavy tasks. In keeping with this hope, robots are machines conceived to aid, augment, or substitute humans. Starting from the last two decades of the twentieth century, laparoscopy allowed surgeons to perform many procedures formerly requiring large incisions (i.e., open surgery) through keyhole openings, thus proportionally reducing surgical trauma. In open surgery, relatively large incisions are required to achieve good exposure of the surgical site and confidently address diseased tissues. Laparoscopic surgery (LS) not only made this possible, but also improved clinical outcomes and became the standard technique for many surgical procedures. However, implementation of conventional LS was limited in some complex operations, such as pancreatoduodenectomy or resection of hilar cholangiocarcinoma because of bidimensional vision, loss of hand\u2013eye alignment, use of rigid instruments with a fulcrum effect and only 4 degrees of freedom, and poor surgeon ergonomics [3]. Robotic surgery, as provided by the da Vinci Surgical System (dVSS) (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), has been the following revolution in surgery, because this system was specifically designed to address most of the technical limitations of conventional LS. The dVss is a master\u2013slave telemanipulator that faithfully reproduces the movements of surgeon\u2019s hands at tip of miniaturized intracorporeal instruments with seven degrees of freedom. Hand\u2013eye coordination is also restored, thanks to an immersive view of the operative field that reproduces the natural alignment between vision, hands, and instruments. When all these features are taken together, the use of a dVSS restores the dexterity of open surgery in minimally invasive operations [4]. The dVSS was initially developed in the context of a military project of telesurgery, aiming to permit a remote surgeon to operate on wounded soldiers on a battlefield. The first robotic system was indeed integrated into a combat vehicle in 1994, and the first ex-vivo telesurgery procedure was performed during a combat exercise [5]. The first human operation, a cholecystectomy, was performed on March 3, 1997 by Himpens and Cadi\u00e8re [6]. In parallel with the dVSS, Zeus\u00ae, another robotic system, was developed by a competing company (Computer Motion\u00ae), but after several surgical procedures, this project was ended in 2003 when Computer Motion\u00ae merged with Intuitive Surgical\u00ae. Several components of Zeus\u00ae were integrated in the subsequent versions of the dVSS. The first dVSS was sold to the Leipzig Heart Center in Germany in late 1998. The device obtained FDA clearance in 2000 [2]. Table 1 reports several first-ever robotic abdominal procedures performed using the dVSS. Time distribution of these procedures demonstrates that in 2003, only 3 years after FDA clearance, there was a peak in the number of reported new robotic operations, demonstrating quick uptake and confident use of the new technology in several different areas. It is also worth to note that some of these procedures were truly complex, such as distal splenopancreatectomy, pancreatoduodenectomy, total gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy, rectal anterior resection, transhiatal esophagectomy, right extended hepatectomy, and radical cystectomy with intra-abdominal formation of orthotopic ileal neobladder.

Review Methods Articles in the database were reviewed for inclusion by 2 independent reviewers according to predetermined eligibility criteria. The references of relevant articles were then hand-searched to identify additional manuscripts. For included articles, the study characteristics and relevant data were extracted. Results Of 103 articles screened, 20 reporting validated measures of QOL and\/or swallow outcomes for 659 patients were eligible for inclusion. Fourteen were observational studies or case series and did not compare the TORS group with another intervention. Two were prospective nonrandomized clinical trials that compared outcomes between TORS and primary chemoradiation. Four were cohort studies comparing TORS with other treatment approaches and modalities, including open surgical approaches and transoral laser microsurgery. Overall, most patients who underwent TORS \u00b1 adjuvant therapy reported a return to baseline QOL and swallow function by 6 to 12 months posttreatment. Several studies demonstrated superior QOL and swallowing outcomes when compared with primary chemoradiation or open approaches.

Thus, there is a need to identify the benefits from RG and its specific candidates. This retrospective study analyzed data from a prospectively collected clinical database at our center. Data of patients with primary gastric cancer undergoing either robotic or laparoscopic radical gastrectomy from June 2014 to June 2020 were reviewed. Surgical outcomes were compared between the two groups, and multivariable analyses were performed to elucidate the relevant factors for postoperative complications in several subgroups. A total of 1172 patients were divided into those who underwent RG (n\u2009=\u2009152) and those who underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) (n\u2009=\u20091020). Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups, except the RG group included more patients undergoing total\/proximal gastrectomy (TG\/PG) and patients at clinical stage III. Compared with the LG group, the RG group had lower incidences of postoperative complications\u2009\u2265\u2009Clavien-Dindo grade III (2\/152 (1.3%) versus 72\/1020 (7.1%); P\u2009=\u20090.004), and intraabdominal complications\u2009\u2265\u2009grade II (6\/152 (3.9%) versus 119\/1020 (11.7%); P\u2009=\u20090.004). Multivariable analysis revealed that RG was a significant relevant factor for reducing overall postoperative complications (\u2265\u2009grade III) (odds ratio (OR) 0.16, P\u2009=\u20090.013), and intraabdominal complications (\u2265\u2009grade II) (OR 0.29, P\u2009=\u20090.002).

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted comparing consecutively performed robotic-assisted and laparoscopic proctectomy with IPAA between 1 January 2016 and 31 September 2021. In total, 67 adult patients with medically refractory UC without proven dysplasia or carcinoma underwent surgery: 29 operated robotically and 38 laparoscopically.

Robotic surgical systems have dramatically changed minimally invasive surgery. Three-dimensional, magnified and stable view, articulated instruments, and reduction of physiologic tremors leading to superior dexterity and ergonomics. Therefore, robotic platforms could potentially address limitations of laparoscopic rectal surgery. It was aimed at reviewing current literature on short-term clinical and oncological (pathological) outcomes after robotic rectal cancer surgery in comparison with laparoscopic surgery. A systematic review was performed for the period 2002 to 2014. A total of 1776 patients with rectal cancer underwent minimally invasive robotic treatment in 32 studies. After robotic and laparoscopic approach to oncologic rectal surgery, respectively, mean operating time varied from 192-385 min, and from 158-297 min; mean estimated blood loss was between 33 and 283 mL, and between 127 and 300 mL; mean length of stay varied from 4-10 d; and from 6-15 d. Conversion after robotic rectal surgery varied from 0% to 9.4%, and from 0 to 22% after laparoscopy. There was no difference between robotic (0%-41.3%) and laparoscopic (5.5%-29.3%) surgery regarding morbidity and anastomotic complications (respectively, 0%-13.5%, and 0%-11.1%). Regarding immediate oncologic outcomes, respectively among robotic and laparoscopic cases, positive circumferential margins varied from 0% to 7.5%, and from 0% to 8.8%; the mean number of retrieved lymph nodes was between 10 and 20, and between 11 and 21; and the mean distal resection margin was from 0.8 to 4.7 cm, and from 1.9 to 4.5 cm. Robotic rectal cancer surgery is being undertaken by experienced surgeons. However, the quality of the assembled evidence does not support definite conclusions about most studies variables. Robotic rectal cancer surgery is associated to increased costs and operating time. It also seems to be associated to reduced conversion rates. Other short-term outcomes are comparable to conventional laparoscopy techniques, if not better. Ultimately, pathological data evaluation suggests that oncologic safety may be preserved after robotic total mesorectal excision. However, further studies are required to evaluate oncologic safety and functional results.","authors":"S. Ara\u00fajo, V. Seid, S.

Such innovations are ever-growing and have now reached the field of cochlear implantation. To implement robotic ear surgery in routine, it is of interest if preoperative planning of a safe trajectory to the middle ear is possible with clinically available image data. Methods: We evaluated the feasibility of robotic cochlear implant surgery in 50 patients (100 ears) scheduled for routine cochlear implant procedures based on clinically available imaging. The primary objective was to assess if available high-resolution computed tomography or cone beam tomography imaging is sufficient for planning a trajectory by an otological software. Secondary objectives were to assess the feasibility of cochlear implant surgery with a drill bit diameter of 1.8 mm, which is the currently used as a standard drill bit. Furthermore, it was evaluated if feasibility of robotic surgery could be increased when using smaller drill bit sizes. Cochlear and trajectory parameters of successfully planned ears were collected. Measurements were carried out by two observers and the interrater reliability was assessed using Cohen's Kappa. Results: Under the prerequisite of the available image data being sufficient for the planning of the procedure, up to two thirds of ears were eligible for robotic cochlear implant surgery with the standard drill bit size of 1.8 mm. The main reason for inability to plan the keyhole access was insufficient image resolution causing anatomical landmarks not being accurately identified. Although currently not applicable in robotic cochlear implantation, narrower drill bit sizes ranging from 1.0 to 1.7 mm in diameter could increase feasibility up to 100%. The interrater agreement between the two observers was good for this data set. Discussion: For robotic cochlear implant surgery, imaging with sufficient resolution is essential for preoperative assessment. A slice thickness of <0.3 mm is necessary for trajectory planning. This can be achieved by using digital volume tomography while radiation exposure can be kept to a minimum. Furthermore, surgeons who use the software tool, should be trained on a regular basis in order to achieve planning consistency.","authors":"A. Auinger, V. Dahm, R. Liepins, D. Riss, W.

We aimed to compare deviations between implant planning and placement with the assistance of dynamic computer-assisted implant surgery (d-CAIS) or autonomous robotic computer-assisted implant surgery (r-CAIS) methods in a clinical setting.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe retrospective analysis of medical records between 2021 July and 2022 December was conducted to compare the implantation accuracy of the d-CAIS and r-CAIS system in partially edentulous patients through cone-beam computed tomography. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were recorded using a visual analogue scale (VAS). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to check the data distribution. Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test was used as appropriate, with a defined significant difference (p\u2009<\u2009.05).\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeventy-seven patients were analysed (124 implants), with 38 patients (62 implants) in the d-CAIS group and 39 patients (62 implants) in the r-CAIS group. The differences between d-CAIS and r-CAIS were 4.09\u2009\u00b1\u20091.79\u00b0 versus 1.37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.92\u00b0 (p\u2009<\u2009.001) in angular deviation; 1.25\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 versus 0.68\u2009\u00b1\u20090.36\u2009mm (p\u2009<\u2009.001) in coronal global deviation; 1.39\u2009\u00b1\u20090.52 versus 0.69\u2009\u00b1\u20090.36\u2009mm (p\u2009<\u2009.001) in apical global deviation; the results of the PROMs showed no statistical difference between the two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nr-CAIS allows more accurate implant placement than the d-CAIS technology. And both groups achieved overall satisfactory outcomes via VAS (Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR2300072004).","authors":"Sihui Zhang, Qin Cai, Weiyi Chen, Yuxuan Lin, Yan Gao, Dong Wu, Jiang Chen","year":2023,"url":"https:\/\/www.semanticscholar.org\/paper\/b969f4328aada95e916bb2a9b3ebdd95119f8651"},{"title":"Systematic review of operative outcomes of robotic surgical procedures performed with endoscopic linear staplers or robotic staplers","abstract":"A comprehensive review of operative outcomes of robotic surgical procedures performed with the da Vinci robotic system using either endoscopic linear staplers (ELS) or robotic staplers is not available in the published literature. We conducted a literature search to identify publications of robotic surgical procedures in all specialties performed with either ELS or robotic staplers. Twenty-nine manuscripts and six abstracts with relevant information on operative outcomes published from January 2011 to September 2017 were identified. Given the relatively recent market release of robotic staplers in 2014, comparative perioperative clinical outcomes data on the performance of ELS vs. robotic staplers in robotic surgery is very sparse in the published literature. Only three comparative studies of surgeries with the da Vinci robotic system plus ELS vs. da Vinci plus robotic staplers were identified; two in robotic colorectal surgery and the other in robotic gastric bypass surgery. These comparative studies illustrate some nuances in device design and usability, which may impact outcomes and cost, and therefore may be important to consider when selecting the appropriate stapling technologies\/technique for different robotic surgeries. Comparative perioperative data on the use of ELS vs. robotic staplers in robotic surgery is scarce (three studies), and current literature identifies both types of devices as safe and effective. Given the longer clinical history of ELS and its relatively more robust evidence base, there may be trade-offs to consider before switching to robotic staplers in certain robotic procedures. However, this literature review may serve as an initial reference for future research.","authors":"Mario Guti\u00e9rrez, R.

It is important to know whether the existing open or laparoscopic skills of robotic novices shorten the robotic surgery learning curve, potentially reducing the amount of training required. This systematic review aims to assess psychomotor skill transfer to the robot in clinical and simulated settings. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Scopus databases were systematically searched in accordance with PRISMA guidelines from inception to August 2021 alongside website searching and citation chaining. Article screening, data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken by two independent reviewers. Outcomes included simulator performance metrics or in the case of clinical studies, peri- and post-operative metrics. Twenty-nine studies met the eligibility criteria. All studies were judged to be at high or moderate overall risk of bias. Results were narratively synthesised due to heterogeneity in study designs and outcome measures. Two of the three studies assessing open surgical skill transfer found evidence of successful skill transfer while nine of twenty-seven studies evaluating laparoscopic skill transfer found no evidence. Skill transfer from both modalities is most apparent when advanced robotic tasks are performed in the initial phase of the learning curve but quality and methodological limitations of the existing literature prevent definitive conclusions. The impact of incorporating laparoscopic simulation into robotic training curricula and on the cost effectiveness of training should be investigated.","authors":"B. Chahal, A.

The optimal management of early-stage OPSCC with surgery or radiation continues to be a clinical controversy. Long-term randomized data comparing these paradigms are lacking. METHODS We randomly assigned patients with T1-T2, N0-2 (\u2264 4 cm) OPSCC to radiotherapy (RT) (with chemotherapy if N1-2) versus transoral robotic surgery plus neck dissection (TORS + ND) (with or without adjuvant therapy). The primary end point was swallowing quality of life (QOL) at 1-year using the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory. Secondary end points included adverse events, other QOL outcomes, overall survival, and progression-free survival. All analyses were intention-to-treat. Herein, we present long-term outcomes from the trial. RESULTS Sixty-eight patients were randomly assigned (n = 34 per arm) between August 10, 2012, and June 9, 2017. Median follow-up was 45 months. Longitudinal MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory analyses demonstrated statistical superiority of RT arm over time (P = .049), although the differences beyond 1 year were of smaller magnitude than at the 1-year timepoint (year 2: 86.0 \u00b1 13.5 in the RT arm v 84.8 \u00b1 12.5 in the TORS + ND arm, P = .74; year 3: 88.9 \u00b1 11.3 v 83.3 \u00b1 13.9, P = .12). These differences did not meet the threshold to qualify as a clinically meaningful change at any timepoint. Certain differences in QOL concerns including more pain and dental concerns in the TORS + ND arm seen at 1 year resolved at 2 and 3 years; however, TORS patients started to use more nutritional supplements at 3 years (P = .015). Dry mouth scores were higher in RT patients over time (P = .041). CONCLUSION On longitudinal analysis, the swallowing QOL difference between primary RT and TORS + ND approaches persists but decreases over time. Patients with OPSCC should be informed about the pros and cons of both treatment options (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01590355).","authors":"A. Nichols, J. Theurer, E. Prisman, N. Read, E.
